<h2>CHAPTER I.</h2>

<h3>FAREWELL SUNDAY.</h3>


<div class="drop">
<img src="images/i_011.jpg" alt="T" width="100" height="100" class="cap" />
 <p class="cap_1">The morning of Sunday, August 23, in the year of
grace 1662, should have been black and gloomy with
the artillery of rolling thunder, dreadful flashes of
lightning, and driving hail and wind to strip the
orchards and lay low the corn. For on that day
was done a thing which filled the whole country with grief, and bore
bitter fruit in after years, of revenge and rebellion. And, because
it was the day before that formerly named after Bartholomew, the
disciple, it hath been called the Black Bartholomew of England,
thus being likened unto that famous day (approved by the Pope)
when the French Protestants were treacherously massacred by their
King. It should rather be called 'Farewell Sunday' or 'Exile
Sunday,' for on that day two thousand godly ministers preached
their last sermon in the churches where they had laboured worthily
and with good fruit, some during the time of the Protector, and
some even longer, because among them were a few who possessed
their benefices even from the time of the late King Charles the
First. And, since on that day two thousand ministers left their
churches and their houses, and laid down their worldly wealth for
conscience' sake, there were also, perhaps, as many wives who went
with them, and, I dare say, three or four times as many innocent
and helpless babes. And, further (it is said that the time was fixed
by design and deliberate malice of our enemies), the ministers were
called upon to make their choice only a week or two before the day
of the collection of their tithes. In other words, they were sent
forth to the world at the season when their purses were at the
leanest; indeed, with most country clergymen, their purses shortly
before the collection of tithes have become well-nigh empty.
It was also unjust that their successors should be permitted to
collect the tithes due to those who were ejected.</p></div>

<p>It is fitting to begin this history with the Black Bartholomew,
because all the troubles and adventures which afterwards befell us
were surely caused by that accursed day. One know not certainly,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
what other rubs might have been ordained for us by a wise Providence
(always with the merciful design of keeping before our eyes
the vanity of worldly things, the instability of fortune, the uncertainty
of life, and the wisdom of looking for a hereafter which shall be
lasting, stable, and satisfying to the soul). Still, it must be confessed,
such trials as were appointed unto us were, in severity and
continuance, far beyond those appointed to the ordinary sort, so
that I cannot but feel at times uplifted (I hope not sinfully) at
having been called upon to endure so much. Let me not, however,
be proud. Had it not been for this day, for certain, our boys would
not have been tempted to strike a blow&mdash;vain and useless as it
proved&mdash;for the Protestant religion and for liberty of conscience:
while perhaps I should now be forbidden to relate our sufferings,
were it not for the glorious Revolution which has restored toleration,
secured the Protestant ascendancy, and driven into banishment a
Prince, concerning whom all honest men pray that he and his son
(if he have, indeed, a son of his own) may never again have authority
over this realm.</p>

<p>This Sunday, I say, should have wept tears of rain over the havoc
which it witnessed; yet it was fine and clear, the sun riding in
splendour, and a warm summer air blowing among the orchards
and over the hills and around the village of Bradford Orcas, in the
shire of Somerset. The wheat (for the season was late) stood gold-coloured
in the fields, ready at last for the reaper; the light breeze
bent down the ears so that they showed like waves over which the
passing clouds make light and shade; the apples in the orchards
were red and yellow, and nearly ripe for the press; in the gardens
of the Manor House, hard by the church, the sunflowers and the
hollyhocks were at their tallest and their best; the yellow roses on
the wall were still in clusters; the sweet-peas hung with tangles of
vine and flower upon their stalks; the bachelors' buttons, the sweet
mignonette, the nasturtium, the gillyflowers and stocks, the sweet-williams
and the pansies, offered their late summer blossoms to the
hot sun among the lavender, thyme, parsley, sage, feverfew, and
vervain of my Lady's garden. Oh! I know how it all looked,
though I was then as yet unborn. How many times have I stood
in the churchyard and watched the same scene at the same sweet
season! On a week-day one hears the thumping and the groaning
of the mill below the church; there are the voices of the men at
work&mdash;the yo-hoing of the boys who drive; and the lumbering of
the carts. You can even hear the spinning-wheels at work in the
cottages. On Sunday morning everything is still, save for the
warbling of the winged tribe in the wood, the cooing of the doves
in the cote, the clucking of the hens, the grunting of the pigs, and
the droning of the bees. These things disturb not the meditations
of one who is accustomed to them.</p>

<p>At eight o'clock in the morning, the Sexton, an ancient man
and rheumatic, hobbled slowly through the village, key in hand,
and opened the church-door. Then he went into the tower and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
rang the first bell. I suppose this bell is designed to hurry housewives
with their morning work, and to admonish the men that they
incline their hearts to a spiritual disposition. This done, the Sexton
set open the doors of the pews, swept out the Squire's and the
Rector's in the chancel, dusted the cushions of the pulpit (the
reading-desk at this time was not used), opened the clasps of the
great Bible, and swept down the aisle: as he had done Sunday after
Sunday for fifty years. When he had thus made the church ready
for the day's service, he went into the vestry, which had only been
used since the establishment of the Commonwealth for the registers
of birth, death, and marriage.</p>

<p>At one side of the vestry stood an ancient, black oak coffer, the
sides curiously graven, and a great rusty key in the lock. The
Sexton turned the key with difficulty, threw open the lid and
looked in.</p>

<p>'Ay,' he said, chuckling, 'the old surplice and the old Book of
Common Prayer. Ye have had a long rest; 'tis time for both to
come out again. When the surplice is out, the book will stay no
longer locked up. These two go in and out together. I mind me,
now'&mdash;&mdash;Here he sat down, and his thoughts wandered for a
space; perhaps he saw himself once more a boy running in the
fields, or a young man courting a maid. Presently he returned to
the task before him, and drew forth an old and yellow roll which
he shook out. It was the surplice which had once been white.
'Here you be,' he said. 'Put you away for a matter of twelve
year and more and you bide your time; you know you will come
back again; you are not in any hurry. Even the Sexton dies; but
you die not, you bide your time. Everything comes again. The
old woman shall give you a taste o' the suds and the hot iron.
Thus we go up and thus we go down.' He put back the surplice
and took out the great Book of Common Prayer&mdash;musty and damp
after twelve years' imprisonment. 'Fie!' he said, 'thy leather is
parting from the boards, and thy leaves they do stick together.
Shalt have a pot of paste, and then lie in the sun before thou goest
back to the desk. Whether 'tis Mass or Common Prayer, whether
'tis Independent or Presbyterian, folk mun still die and be buried&mdash;ay,
and married and born&mdash;whatever they do say. Parson goes
and Preacher comes; Preacher goes and Parson comes; but Sexton
stays'&mdash;&mdash;He chuckled again, put back the surplice and the
book, and locked the coffer.</p>

<p>Then he slowly went down the church and came out of the
porch, blinking in the sun, and shading his old eyes. He sat down
upon the flat stones of the old cross, and presently nodded his head
and dropped off asleep.</p>

<p>This was a strange indifference in the man. A great and truly
notable thing was to be accomplished that day. But he cared nothing.
Two thousand godly and learned men were to go forth into poverty
for liberty of conscience&mdash;this man's own minister was one of them.
He cared nothing. The King was sowing the seed from which should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
spring a rod to drive forth his successor from the kingdom. In the
village the common sort were not moved. Nothing concerns the
village folk but the weather and the market prices. As for the good
Sexton, he was very old: he had seen the Church of England displaced
by the Presbyterians and the Presbyterians by the Independents,
and now these were again to be supplanted by the Church
of England. He had been Sexton through all these changes. He
heeded them not; why, his father, Sexton before him, could
remember when the Mass was said in the church, and the Virgin
was worshipped, and the folk were driven like sheep to confession.
All the time the people went on being born, and marrying, and
dying. Creed doth not, truly, affect these things, nor the Sexton's
work. Therefore, this old gaffer, having made sure that the
surplice was in the place where it had lain undisturbed for a dozen
years, and remembering that it must be washed and ironed for the
following Sunday, sat down to bask in the sun, his mind at rest,
and dropped off into a gentle sleep.</p>

<p>At ten o'clock the bell-ringers came tramping up the stone steps
from the road, and the Sexton woke up. At ten they used to
begin their chimes, but at the hour they ring for five minutes only,
ending with the clash of all five bells together. At a quarter-past ten
they chime again, for the service, which begins at half-past ten.</p>

<p>At the sound of these chimes the whole village begins to move
slowly towards the church. First come the children, the bigger
ones leading those who are little by the hand; the boys come next,
but unwillingly, because the Sexton is diligent with his cane, and
some of those who now go up the steps to the church will come
down with smarting backs, the reward of those who play or laugh
during the service. Then come the young men, who stand about
the churchyard and whisper to each other. After them follow the
elders and the married men, with the women and the girls. Five
minutes before the half hour the ringers change the chime for a
single bell. Then those who are outside gather in the porch and
wait for the Quality.</p>

<p>When the single bell began, there came forth from the Rectory
the Rector himself, Mr. Comfort Eykin, Doctor of Divinity, who
was this day to deliver his soul and lay down his charge. He wore
the black gown and Geneva bands, for the use of which he contended.
At this time he was a young man of thirty&mdash;tall and
thin. He stooped in the shoulders because he was continually
reading; his face was grave and austere; his nose thin and aquiline;
his eyes bright&mdash;never was any man with brighter eyes than
my father; his hair, which he wore long, was brown and curly;
his forehead high, rather than broad; his lips were firm. In these
days, as my mother hath told me, and as I well believe, he was a
man of singular comeliness, concerning which he cared nothing.
Always from childhood upwards he had been grave in conversation
and seriously inclined in mind. If I think of my father as a boy
(no one ever seems to think that his father was once a boy), I am<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
fain to compare him with Humphrey, save for certain bodily defects,
my father having been like a Priest of the Altar for bodily perfection.
That is to say, I am sure that, like Humphrey, he had no
need of rod or ferule to make him learn his lessons, and, like that
dear and fond friend of my childhood, he would willingly sit in a
corner and read a book while the other boys played and went a-hunting
or a-nesting. And very early in life he was smitten with
the conviction of sin, and blessed with such an inward assurance of
salvation as made him afterwards steadfast in all afflictions.</p>

<p>He was not a native of this country, having been born in New
England. He came over, being then eighteen years of age, to study
at Oxford, that university being purged of malignants (as they
were then called), and, at the time, entirely in the hands of the
godly. He was entered of Balliol College, of which Society he became
a Fellow, and was greatly esteemed for his learning, wherein
he excelled most of the scholars of his time. He knew and could
read Hebrew, Chaldee, and the ancient Syriac, as well as Latin and
Greek. Of modern languages he had acquired Arabic, by the help
of which he read the book which is called the Koran of the False
Prophet Mohammed: French and Italian he also knew and could
read easily. As for his opinions, he was an Independent, and that
not meekly or with hesitation, but with such zeal and vehemence
that he considered all who differed from him as his private enemies&mdash;nay,
the very enemies of God. For this reason, and because his
personal habits were too austere for those who attained not to his
spiritual height, he was more feared than loved. Yet his party
looked upon him as one of their greatest and stoutest champions.</p>

<p>He left Oxford at the age of five or six and twenty, and
accepted the living of Bradford Orcas, offered him by Sir Christopher
Challis of that place. Here he had preached for six years,
looking forward to nothing else than to remain there, advancing in
grace and wisdom, until the end of his days. So much was ordered,
indeed, for him; but not quite as he had designed. Let no man
say that he knoweth the future, or that he can shape out his destiny.
You shall hear presently how Benjamin arrogantly resolved
that his future should be what he chose; and what came of that
impious resolution.</p>

<p>My father's face was always austere; this morning it was more
serious and sterner than customary, because the day was to him
the most important in his life, and he was about to pass from a
condition of plenty (the Rectory of Bradford Orcas is not rich but
it affords a sufficiency) to one of penury. Those who knew him,
however, had no doubt of the course he was about to take. Even
the rustics knew that their minister would never consent to wear a
surplice or to read the Book of Common Prayer, or to keep holy
days&mdash;you have seen how the Sexton opened the box and took out
the surplice; yet my father had said nothing to him concerning
his intentions.</p>

<p>In his hand he carried his Bible&mdash;his own copy, I have it still,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
the margins covered with notes in his writing&mdash;bound in black leather,
worn by constant handling, with brass clasps. Upon his head
he had a plain black silk cap, which he wore constantly in his study
and at meals to keep off draughts. Indeed, I loved to see him
with the silk cap rather than with his tall steeple hat, with neither
ribbon nor ornament of any kind, in which he rode when he afterwards
went about the country to break the law in exhorting and
praying with his friends.</p>

<p>Beside him walked my mother, holding in her hand her boy, my
brother Barnaby, then three years of age. As for me, I was not
yet born. She had been weeping; her eyes were red and swollen
with tears; but when she entered the church she wept no more,
bravely listening to the words which condemned to poverty and
hardship herself and her children, if any more should be born to
her. Alas, poor soul! What had she done that this affliction
should befall her? What had her innocent boy done? For upon
her&mdash;not upon her husband&mdash;would fall the heavy burden of
poverty, and on her children the loss. Yet never by a single word of
complaint did she make her husband sorry that he had obeyed the
voice of conscience, even when there was nothing left in the house,
not so much as the widow's cruse of oil. Alas, poor mother, once
so free from care! what sorrow and anxiety wert thou destined to
endure for the tender conscience of thy husband!</p>

<p>At the same time&mdash;namely, at the ringing of the single bell&mdash;there
came forth from the Manor House hard by the church, his
Honour, Sir Christopher, with his family. The worthy knight was
then about fifty years of age, tall and handsome still&mdash;in his later
years there was something of a heavenly sweetness in his face,
created, I doubt not, by a long life of pious thoughts and worthy
deeds. His hair was streaked with grey, but not yet white; he
wore a beard of the kind called stiletto, which was even then an
ancient fashion, and he was dressed more soberly than is common
with gentlemen of his rank, having no feather in his hat, but a
simple ribbon round it, and though his ruffles were of lace and the
kerchief round his neck was lace, the colour of his coat was plain
brown. He leaned upon a gold-headed cane on account of an old
wound (it was inflicted by a Cavalier's musket-ball when he was a
Captain in the army of Lord Essex). The wound left him somewhat
lame, yet not so lame but that he could very well walk about
his fields and could ride his horse, and even hunt with the otter-hounds.
By his side walked Madam, his wife. After him came
his son, Humphrey, newly married, and with Humphrey his wife;
and last came his son-in-law, the Reverend Philip Boscorel, M.A.,
late Fellow of All Souls' College, Oxford, also newly married,
with his wife, Sir Christopher's daughter, Patience. Mr. Boscorel,
like my father, was at that time thirty years of age. Like him,
too, his face was comely and his features fine; yet they lacked the
fire and the earnestness which marked my father. And in his
silken cassock, his small white bands, his lace ruffles, and his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
dainty walk, it seemed as if Mr. Boscorel thought himself above
the common run of mankind and of superior clay. 'Tis sometimes
the way with scholars and those who survey the world from the
eminence of a library.</p>

<p>Sir Christopher's face was full of concern, because he loved the
young man who was this day to throw away his livelihood; and
although he was ready himself to worship after the manner prescribed
by law, his opinions were rather Independent than Episcopalian.
As for Mr. Boscorel, who was about to succeed to the
ejected minister, his face wore no look of triumph, which would
have been ungenerous. He was observed, indeed, after he had
silently gone through the Service of the day with the help of the
Common Prayer-book, to listen diligently unto the preacher.</p>

<p>The people, I have already said, knew already what was about
to happen. Perhaps some of them (but I think not) possessed a
copy of the old Prayer-book. This, they knew, was to be restored,
with the surplice, and the observance of Holy days, Feasts, and
Fasts, and the kneeling at the administration of the Holy Communion.
Our people are craftsmen as much as they are rustics;
every week the master-clothiers' men drive their packhorses into
the village laden with wool, and return with yarn; they are not,
therefore, so brutish and sluggish as most country folk; yet they
made no outward show of caring whether Prelacy or Independency
was to have the sway. Perhaps the abstruse doctrines which my
father loved to discuss were too high for them; perhaps his austerity
was too strict for them, so that he was not beloved by them.
Perhaps, even, they would have cared little if they had heard that
Bishop Bonner himself was coming back. Religion, to country
folk, means, mostly, the going to church on Sunday morning.
That done, man's service of Prayer and Praise to his Creator is
also done. If the form be changed the church remains, and the
churchyard; one shepherd followeth another, but the flock is
always the same. Revolutions overthrow kings, and send great
heads to the block; but the village heedeth not unless civil war
pass that way. To country folk, what difference? The sky and
the fields are unchanged. Under Queen Mary they are Papists;
under Queen Elizabeth they are Protestants. They have the
Prayer-book under King James and King Charles; under Oliver
they have had the Presbyterian and Independent; now they have
the Book of Common Prayer and the surplice again. Yet they
remain the same people, and tell the same stories, and, so far as I
know, believe the same things&mdash;viz., that Christ Jesus saves the
soul of every man who truly believes in Him. Why, if it were not
for his immortal soul&mdash;concerning which he takes but little thought&mdash;the
rustic might be likened unto the patient beast whom he harnesseth
to his plough and to his muck-cart. He changeth no more;
he works as hard; he is as long-enduring; his eyes and his thoughts
are as much bound by the hedge, the lane, and the field; he thinks
and invents and advances no more. Were it not, I say, for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
Church, he would take as little heed of anything as his ox or his
ass; his village would become his country; his squire would
become his king; the nearest village would become the camp of an
enemy; and he would fall into the condition of the Ancient Briton
when Julius CÃ¦sar found every tribe fighting against every other.</p>

<p>I talk as a fool. For sometimes there falls upon the torpid soul
of the rustic a spark which causes a mighty flame to blaze up and
burn fiercely within him. I have read how a simple monk, called
Peter the Hermit, drew thousands of poor, illiterate, credulous
persons from their homes, and led them, a mob armed with scythes
and pikes, across Europe to the deserts of Asia Minor, where they
miserably perished. I have read also of Jack Cade, and how he
drew the multitudes after him, crying aloud for justice or death.
And I myself have seen these sluggish spirits suddenly fired with a
spirit which nothing could subdue. The sleeping soul I have seen
suddenly starting into life; strength and swiftness have I seen
suddenly put into sluggish limbs; light and fire have I seen gleaming
suddenly in dull and heavy eyes. Oh! it was a miracle: but I
have seen it. And having seen it, I cannot despise these lads of
the plough, these honest boys of Somerset, nor can I endure to hear
them laughed at or contemned.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Bradford Orcas, in the Hundred of Horethorne, Somerset, is a
village so far from the great towns, that one would think a minister
might have gone on praying and preaching after his own fashion
without ever being discovered. But the arm of the Law is long.</p>

<p>The nearest town is Sherborne, in Dorsetshire, to which there
is a bridle-path across the fields; it is the market-town for the
villages round it. Bradford Orcas is an obscure little village, with
no history and no antiquities. It stands in the south-eastern corner
of the county, close to the western declivity of the Corton Hills,
which here sweep round so as to form a valley, in which the village
is built along the banks of a stream. The houses are for the most
part of stone, with thatched roofs, as is the custom in our country;
the slopes of the hills are covered with trees, and round the village
stand goodly orchards, the cider from which cannot be surpassed.
As for the land, but little of it is arable; the greater part is a sandy
loam or stone brash. The church, which in the superstitious days
was dedicated to St. Nicolas, is built upon a hillock, a rising
ground in the west of the village. This building of churches upon
hillocks is a common custom in our parts, and seemeth laudable,
because a church should stand where it can be seen by all the
people, and by its presence remind them of Death and of the
Judgment. The practice doth obtain, for example, at Sherborne,
where there is a very noble church, and at Huish Episcopi, and at
many other places in our county. Our church is fair and commodious,
not too large for the congregation, having in the west a
stone tower embattled, and consisting of a nave and chancel with a
very fine roof of carved woodwork. There is an ancient yew-tree<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
in the churchyard, from which in old times bows were cut; some
of the bows yet hang in the great hall of the Manor House. Among
the graves is an ancient stone cross, put up no man knows when,
standing in a six-sided slab of stone, but the top was broken off at
the time of the Reformation; two or three tombs are in the churchyard,
and the rest is covered with mounds, beneath which lie the
bones and dust of former generations.</p>

<p>Close to the churchyard, and at the north-east corner, is the
Manor House, as large as the church itself, but not so ancient. It
was built in the reign of Henry VII. A broad arched gateway
leads into a court, wherein is the entrance to the house. Over the
gateway is a kind of tower, but not detached from the house. In
the wall of the tower is a panel, lozenge-shaped, in which are carved
the arms of the Challis family. The house is stately, with many
gables, and in each are casement windows set in richly-carved stone
tracery. As for the rooms within the house, I will speak of them
hereafter. At present I have the churchyard in my mind. There
is no place upon the earth which more I love. To stand in the long
grass among the graves; to gaze upon the wooded hills beyond, the
orchards, the meadows, the old house, the venerable church, the
yew-tree: to listen to the murmur of the stream below and the
singing of the lark above; to feel the fresh breeze upon my cheek&mdash;oh!
I do this daily. It makes me feel young once more; it brings
back the days when I stood here with the boys, and when Sir
Christopher would lean over the wall and discourse with us gravely
and sweetly upon the love of God and the fleeting joys of earth
(which yet, he said, we should accept and be happy withal in thankfulness),
and the happiness unspeakable that awaiteth the Lord's
Saints. Or, if my thoughts continue in the past, the graveyard
brings back the presence and the voice of Mr. Boscorel.</p>

<p>'In such a spot as this,' he would say, speaking softly and
slowly, 'the pastorals of Virgil or Theocritus might have been
written. Here would the shepherds hold their contests. Certainly
they could find no place, even in sunny Sicily or at Mantua itself,
where (save for three months in the year) the air is more delightful.
Here they need not to avoid the burning heat of a sun which gently
warms, but never burns; here they would find the shade of the
grove pleasant in the soft summer season. Innocent lambs instead
of kids (which are tasteless) play in our meadows; the cider which
we drink is, I take it, more pleasing to the palate than was their
wine flavoured with turpentine. And our viols, violins, and spinets
are instruments more delightful than the oaten pipe, or the cithara
itself.' Then would he wave his hand, and quote some poet in
praise of a country life&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">There is no man but may make his paradise,</span>
<span class="i0">And it is nothing but his love and dotage</span>
<span class="i0">Upon the world's foul joys that keeps him out on't.</span>
<span class="i0">For he that lives retired in mind and spirit</span>
<span class="i0">Is still in Paradise.</span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span></p>
<p>'But, child,' he would add, with a sigh, 'one may not always
wish to be in Paradise. The world's joys lie elsewhere. Only, when
youth is gone&mdash;then Paradise is best.'</p>

<p>The service began, after the manner of the Independents, with a
long prayer, during which the people sat. Mr. Boscorel, as I have
said, went through his own service in silence, the Book of Common
Prayer in his hand. After the prayer, the minister read a portion
of Scripture, which he expounded at length and with great learning.
Then the congregation sang that Psalm which begins&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Triumphing songs with glorious tongues</span>
<span class="i0">Let's offer unto Him.</span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>This done, the Rector ascended the pulpit for the last time,
gave out his text, turned his hour-glass, and began his sermon.</p>

<p>He took for his text those verses in St. Paul's second epistle to
the Corinthians, vi., 3-10, in which the Apostle speaks of his own
ministry as if he was actually predicting the tribulation which was
to fall upon these faithful preachers of a later time&mdash;'In much
patience, in afflictions, in necessities, in distresses, in stripes, in imprisonments,
in tumults, in labours, in watchings, in fastings,'&mdash;could
not the very words be applied to my father?</p>

<p>He read the text three times, so that everybody might fully
understand the subject upon which he was to preach&mdash;namely, the
faithfulness required of a minister of the gospel. I need not set
down the arguments he used or the reasons he gave for his resolution
not to conform with the Act of Uniformity. The rustics sat
patiently listening, with no outward sign of assent or of sympathy.
But their conduct afterwards proved abundantly to which side their
minds inclined.</p>

<p>It behoves us all to listen with respect when scholars and wise
men inquire into the reasons of things. Yet the preachings and
expositions which such as my father bestowed upon their flocks did
certainly awaken men's minds to consider by themselves the things
which many think too high for them. It is a habit which may lead
to the foundation of false and pernicious sects. And it certainly is
not good that men should preach the doctrines of the Anabaptists,
the Fifth Monarchy men, or the Quakers. Yet it is better that
some should be deceived than that all should be slaves. I have
been assured by one&mdash;I mean Humphrey&mdash;who hath travelled,
that in those countries where the priest taketh upon himself the
religion of the people, so that they think to be saved by attending
mass, by fasting, confession, penance, and so forth, not only does
religion itself become formal, mechanical, and inanimate, but in the
very daily concerns and business of life men grow slothful and lack
spirit. Their religion, which is the very heat of the body, the
sustaining and vital force of all man's actions, is cold and dead.
Therefore, all the virtues are cold also, and with them the courage
and the spirit of the people. Thus it is that Italy hath fallen aside
into so many small and divided kingdoms. And for this reason,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
Spain, in the opinion of those who know her best, is now falling
rapidly into decay.</p>

<p>I am well assured, by those who can remember, that the intelligence
of the village folk greatly increased during the period when
they were encouraged to search the Scriptures for themselves.
Many taught themselves to read, others had their children taught,
in order that they might read or hear, daily, portions of the Scriptures.
It is now thirty years since Authority resumed the rule;
the village folk have again become, to outward seeming, sheep who
obey without questioning. Yet it is observed that when they are
within reach of a town&mdash;that is to say, of a meeting-house&mdash;they
willingly flock to the service in the afternoon and evening.</p>

<p>It was with the following brave words that my father concluded
his discourse:&mdash;</p>

<p>'Seeing, therefore, my brethren, how clear is the Word of God
on these points; and considering that we must always obey God
rather than man; and observing that here we plainly see the
finger of God pointing to disobedience and its consequences, I am
constrained to disobey. The consequence will be to me that I
shall stand in this place no more: to you, that you will have a
stranger in your church. I pray that he may be a godly person,
able to divide the Word, learned and acceptable.</p>

<p>'As for me, I must go forth, perhaps from among you altogether.
If persecutions arise, it may behove me and mine to seek
again that land beyond the seas whither my fathers fled for the
sake of religious liberty. Whatever happens, I must fain preach
the gospel. It is laid upon me to preach. If I am silent, it will be
as if Death itself had fallen upon me. My brethren, there have
been times&mdash;and those times may return&mdash;when the Elect have had
to meet, secretly, on the sides of barren hills, and in the heart of
the forest, to pray together and to hear the Word. I say that
these times may return. If they do, you will find me willing, I
hope and pray, to brave for you the worst that our enemies can
devise. Perhaps, however, this tyranny may pass over. Already
the Lord hath achieved one great deliverance for this ancient Realm.
Perhaps another may be in His secret purposes when we have been
chastened, as, for our many sins, we richly deserve. Whether in
affliction or in prosperity, let us always say, "The Lord's name be
praised!"</p>

<p>'Now, therefore, for the sand is running low and I may not
weary the young and the impatient, let me conclude. Farewell,
sweet Sabbaths! Farewell, the sweet expounding of the Word!
Farewell, sweet pulpit! Farewell, sweet faces of the souls which
I have yearned to present pure and washed clean before the Throne!
My brethren, I go about, henceforth, as a dog which is muzzled;
another man will fill this pulpit; our simple form of worship is
gone; the Prayer-book and the surplice have come back again. Pray
God we see not Confession, Penance, the Mass, the Inquisition, the
enslavement of conscience, the stake, and the martyr's axe!'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span></p>

<p>Then he paused and bowed his head, and everybody thought
that he had finished.</p>

<p>He had not. He raised it again, and threw out his arms and
shouted aloud, while his eyes glowed like fire:</p>

<p>'<em>No!</em> I will not be silent. I <small>WILL NOT</small>. I am sent into the
world to preach the gospel. I have no other business. I must
proclaim the Word as I hope for everlasting life. Brethren, we
shall meet again. In the woods and on the hills we shall find a
Temple; there are houses where two or three may be gathered
together, the Lord Himself being in their midst. Never doubt
that I am ready, in season and out of season, whatever be the law,
to preach the gospel of the Lord!'</p>

<p>He ended, and straightway descended the pulpit stair, and
stalked out of the church, the people looking after him with awe
and wonder. But Mr. Boscorel smiled and wagged his head, with
a kind of pity.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II.</h2>

<h3>IN THE VILLAGE.</h3>


<div class="drop">
<img src="images/i_023.jpg" alt="T" width="100" height="102" class="cap" />
 <p class="cap_1">Thus did my father, by his own act
and deed, strip himself of all his
worldly wealth. Yet, having nothing,
he ceased not to put his trust in the
Lord, and continued to sit among his
books, never asking whence came the
food provided for him. I think, indeed,
so wrapt was he in thought, that
he knew not. As for procuring the
daily food, my mother it was who found
out the way.</p>
</div>

<p>Those who live in other parts of
this kingdom do not know what a busy and populous county is
that of Somerset. Apart from the shipping and the great trade
with Ireland, Spain, and the West Indies carried on from the
Port of Bristol, we have our great manufactures of cloth, in
which we are surpassed by no country in the world. The town
of Taunton alone can boast of eleven hundred looms always at
work making Sagathies and Des Roys; there are many looms
at Bristol, where they make for the most part Druggets and Cantaloons;
and there are great numbers at that rich and populous
town of Frome Selwood, where they manufacture the Spanish
Medleys. Besides the cloth-workers, we have, in addition, our
knitted-stocking trade, which is carried on mostly at Glastonbury
and Shepton Mallet. Not only does this flourishing trade
make the masters rich and prosperous (it is not uncommon to find
a master with his twenty&mdash;ay, and his forty&mdash;thousand pounds),
but it fills all the country with work, so that the towns are frequent,
populous, and full of everything that men can want; and
the very villages are not like those which may be seen in other
parts, poor and squalid, but well-built and comfortable.</p>

<p>Every cottage has its spinning-wheel. The mother, when she
is not doing the work of the house, sits at the wheel; the girls,
when they have nothing else to do, are made to knit stockings.
Every week the master-clothier sends round his men among the
villages, their packhorses laden with wool; every week they return,
their packs laden with yarn, ready for the loom.</p>

<p>There is no part of England where the people are more prosperous
and more contented. Nowhere are there more towns, and
all thriving; nowhere are the villages better built; nor can one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
find anywhere else more beautiful churches. Because the people
make good wages they are independent in their manners; they
have learned things supposed to be above the station of the humble;
most of them in the towns, and many in the villages, are able to
read. This enables them to search the Scriptures, and examine
into doctrine by the light of their own reason, guided by grace.
And to me, the daughter of a Nonconforming preacher, it does not
seem wonderful that so many of them should have become stiff
and sturdy Nonconformists. This was seen in the year 1685, and,
again, three years later, when a greater than Monmouth landed on
the western shores.</p>

<p>My mother, then, seeing no hope that her husband would earn,
by any work of his own, the daily bread of the household, bravely
followed the example of the women in the village. That is to say,
she set up her spinning-wheel, and spent all the time that she
could spare spinning the wool into yarn; while she taught her little
boy first and afterwards her daughter&mdash;as soon as I was old enough
to manage the needles&mdash;to knit stockings. What trade, indeed,
could her husband follow save one&mdash;and that, by law, prohibited?
He could not dig; he could not make anything; he knew not how
to buy or sell; he could only study, write, and preach. Therefore,
while he sat among his books in one room, she sat over her wheel in
the other, working for the master-clothiers of Frome Selwood. It
still makes my heart to swell with pity and with love when I think
upon my mother, thus spending herself and being spent, working
all day, huckstering with the rough pack-horsemen more accustomed
to exchange rude jests with the rustics than to talk with gentlewomen.
And this she continued to do year after year, cheerful
and contented, so that her husband should never feel the pinch of
poverty. Love makes us willing slaves.</p>

<p>My father, happily, was not a man whose mind was troubled
about food. He paid no heed at all to what he ate, provided that
it was sufficient for his needs; he would sup his broth of pork and
turnips and bread, after thanks rendered, as if it were the finest
dish in the world; and a piece of cold bacon with a hot cabbage
would be a feast for him. The cider which he drank was brewed
by my mother from her own apples; to him it was as good as if it
had been Sherris or Rhenish. I say that he did not even know
how his food was provided for him; his mind was at all times
occupied with subjects so lofty that he knew not what was done
under his very eyes. The hand of God, he said, doth still support
His faithful. Doubtless we cannot look back upon those years
without owning that we were so supported. But my mother was the
Instrument; nay, my father sometimes even compared himself with
satisfaction unto the Prophet Elijah, whom the ravens fed beside
the brook Cherith, bringing him flesh and bread in the morning
and flesh and bread in the evening. I suppose my father thought
that his bacon and beans came to him in the same manner.</p>

<p>Yet we should sometimes have fared but poorly had it not been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
for the charity of our friends. Many a fat capon, green goose, side
of bacon, and young grunter came to us from the Manor House,
with tobacco, which my father loved, and wine to comfort his soul;
yea, and clothes for us all, else had we gone barefoot and in rags.
In this way was many an ejected Elijah at that time nourished and
supported. Fresh meat we should never have tasted, any more
than the humblest around us, had it not been for our good friends
at the Manor House. Those who live in towns cannot understand
how frugal and yet sufficient may be the fare of those who live in
the country and have gardens and orchards. Cider was our drink,
which we made ourselves; we had some sweet apple-trees, which
gave us a stock of russets and pippins for winter use; we had bees
(but we sold most of our honey at Sherborne market); our garden
grew sallets and onions, beans and the like; skim milk we could
have from the Manor House for the fetching; for breakfast we had
bread and milk, for dinner bread and soft cheese, with a lettuce or
an apple; and bread or bread and butter for supper. For my
father there was always kept a piece of bacon or fat pork.</p>

<p>Our house was one of the cottages in the village: it is a stone
house (often I sit down to look at it, and to remember those days
of humility) with a thick thatch. It had two rooms below and two
garrets above. One room was made into a study or library for my
father, where also he slept upon a pallet. The other was kitchen, spinning
room, parlour, all in one. The door opened upon the garden, and
the floor was of stone, so that it was cold. But when Barnaby
began to find the use of his hands he procured some boards, which
he laid upon the stones, and so we had a wooden floor; and in
winter across the door we hung a blanket or rug to keep off the
wind.</p>

<p>The walls were whitewashed, and over all my mother had
written texts of Scripture with charcoal, so that godly admonition
was ever present to our eyes and minds. She also embroidered
short texts upon our garments, and I have still the cradle in
which I was laid, carved (but I do not know by whose hand) with
a verse from the Word of God. My father used himself, and would
have us employ, the words of the Bible even for the smaller occasions
of daily use; nor would he allow that anything was lawful
unless it was sanctioned by the Bible, holding that in the Word
was everything necessary or lawful. Did Barnaby go shooting
with Sir Christopher and bring home a rabbit?&mdash;Lo! David bade
the children of Israel teach the use of the bow. Did my mother
instruct and amuse me with riddles?&mdash;She had the warrant of
Scripture for it in the example of Samson. Did she sing Psalms
and spiritual songs to while away the time and make her work less
irksome and please her little daughter?&mdash;In the congregation of
Nehemiah there were two hundred forty-and-five singing men and
singing women.</p>

<p>My father read and expounded the Bible to us twice a day&mdash;morning
and evening. Besides the Bible we had few books which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
we could read. As for my mother, poor soul, she had no time to
read. And as for me, when I grew older I borrowed books from
the Manor House or Mr. Boscorel. And there were 'Old Mr.
Dod's Sayings' and 'Plain Directions by Joseph Large' always
on the shelf beside the Bible.</p>

<p>Now, while my father worked in his study and my brother
Barnaby either sat over his lesson-book, his hands rammed into
his hair, as if determined to lose nothing, not the least scrap of his
portion (yet knowing full well that on the morrow there would be
not a word left in his poor unlucky noddle, and once more the
whip), my mother would sit at her wheel earning the daily bread.
And, when I was little, she would tell me, speaking very softly, so
as not to disturb the wrestling of her husband with a knotty argument,
all the things which you have heard&mdash;how my father chose
rather poverty than to worship at the altar of Baal; and how two
thousand pious ministers, like-minded with himself, left their
pulpits and went out into the cold for conscience' sake. So that I
was easily led to think that there were no Christian martyrs and confessors
more excellent and praiseworthy than these ejected ministers
(which still I believe). Then would she tell me further of how
they fared, and how the common people do still reverence them.
There was the history of John Norman, of Bridgwater; Joseph
Chadwick, of Wrenford; Felix Howe, of West Torrington; George
Minton, and many others. She also instructed me very early in
the history of the Protestant uprising over the best half of Europe,
and showed me how, against fearful odds, and after burnings and
tortures unspeakable, the good people of Germany, the Netherlands,
and Great Britain won their freedom from the Pope, so
that my heart glowed within me to think of the great goodness and
mercy which caused me to be born in a Protestant country. And
she instructed me, later, in the wickedness of King Charles, whom
they now call a martyr, and in the plots of that King, and Laud his
Archbishop, and how King and Archbishop were both overthrown
and perished when the people arose and would bear no more. In
fine, my mother made me, from the beginning, a Puritan. As I
remember my mother always, she was pale of cheek and thin, her
voice was gentle; yet with her very gentleness she would make
the blood to run quick in the veins, and the heart to beat.</p>

<p>How have I seen the boys spring to their feet when she has
talked with them of the great civil war and the Revolution! But
always soft and gentle; her blue eyes never flashing; no wrath in
her heart; but the truth, which often causeth righteous anger,
always upon her tongue.</p>

<p>One day, I remember, when I was a little girl playing in the
garden, Mr. Boscorel walked down the village in his great silken
gown, which seemed always new, his lace ruffs, and his white
bands, looking like a Bishop at least, and walking delicately, holding
up his gown to keep it from the dust and mud. When he
spoke it was in a soft voice and a mincing speech, not like our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
plain Somersetshire way. He stopped at our gate, and looked
down the garden. It was a summer day, the doors and windows
of the cottage were open; at our window sat my father bending
over his books, in his rusty gown and black cap, thin and lank; at
the door sat my mother at her wheel.</p>

<p>'Child,' said the Rector, 'take heed thou never forget in thine
age the thing which thou seest daily in thy childhood.'</p>

<p>I knew not what he meant.</p>

<p>'Read and mark,' he said; 'yea, little Alice, learn by heart
what the Wise Man hath said of the good woman: "She layeth
her hands to the spindle ... she maketh fine linen and selleth it
... she eateth not the bread of idleness.... Let her works
praise her in the gates."'</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III.</h2>

<h3>THE BOYS.</h3>


<div class="drop">
<img src="images/i_028.jpg" alt="T" width="100" height="100" class="cap" />
 <p class="cap_1">The family of Challis, of Bradford Orcas, is well known;
here there has always been a Challis from time immemorial.
They are said to have been on the land
before the time of the Conqueror. But because they
have never been a great family, like the Mohuns of
Dunster, but only modest gentle-folk with some four or five hundred
pounds a year, they have not suffered, like those great houses,
from the civil wars, which, when they raged in the land, brought
in their train so many attainders, sequestrations, beheadings, imprisonments,
and fines. Whether the Barons fought, or whether
Cavaliers and Roundheads, the Challises remained at Bradford
Orcas.</p>
</div>

<p>Since the land is theirs and the village, it is reasonable that they
should have done everything that has been done for the place.
One of them built the church, but I know not when; another built
the tower; another gave the peal of bells. He who reigned here
in the time of Henry VII., built the Manor House; another built
the mill; the monuments in the church are all put up to the
memory of Challises dead and gone; there is one, a very stately
tomb, which figures, to the life, Sir William Challis (who died in
the time of Queen Elizabeth), carved in marble, and coloured,
kneeling at a desk; opposite to him is his second wife, Grace, also
kneeling. Behind the husband are three boys, on their knees, and
behind the wife are three girls. Apart from this group is the effigy
of Filipa, Sir Christopher's first wife, with four daughters kneeling
behind her. I was always sorry for Filipa, thus separated and cut
off from the society of her husband. There are brasses on the floor
with figures of other Challises, and tablets in the wall, and the
Challis coat-of-arms is everywhere, cut in lozenges, and painted in
wood, and shining in the east window. It seemed to me, in my
young days, that it was the grandest thing in the world to be a
Challis.</p>

<p>In this family there was a laudable practice with the younger
sons, that they stayed not at home, as is too often their custom,
leading indolent lives without ambition or fortune, but they sallied
forth and sought fortune in trade, or in the Law, or in the Church,
or in foreign service&mdash;wherever fortune is to be honourably won&mdash;so
that, though I daresay some have proved dead and dry branches,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
others have put forth flowers and fruit abundantly, forming new
and vigorous trees sprung from the ancient root. Thus, some have
become judges: and some bishops: and some great merchants:
some have crossed the ocean and are now settled in the Plantations:
some have attained rank and estates in the service of the
Low Countries. Thus, Sir Christopher's brother Humphrey went
to London and became a Levant merchant and adventurer, rising
to great honour and becoming alderman. I doubt not that he
would have been made Lord Mayor but for his untimely death.
And as for his wealth, which was rumoured to be so great&mdash;but you
shall hear of this in due time.</p>

<p>That goodly following of his household which you have seen
enter the church on Farewell Sunday, was shortly afterwards
broken into by death. There fell upon the village (I think it was
in the year 1665) the scourge of a putrid fever, of which there died,
besides numbers of the village folk, Madam herself&mdash;the honoured
wife of Sir Christopher&mdash;Humphrey his son, and Madam Patience
Boscorel, his daughter. There were left to Sir Christopher, therefore,
only his daughter-in-law and his grandsons Robin and Benjamin.
And in that year his household was increased by the
arrival of his grand-nephew Humphrey. This child was the grandson
of Sir Christopher's brother, the Turkey or Levant merchant
of whom I have spoken. He was rich and prosperous: his ships
sailed out every year laden with I know not what, and returned
with figs, dates, spices, gums, silks, and all kinds of precious commodities
from Eastern parts. It is, I have been told, a profitable
trade, but subject to terrible dangers from Moorish pirates, who
must be bravely fought and beaten off, otherwise ship and cargo
will be taken, and captain and crew driven into slavery. Mr.
Challis dwelt in Thames-street, close to Tower-hill. It is said that
he lived here in great splendour, as befits a rich merchant who is
also an Alderman.</p>

<p>Now, in the year 1665, as is very well known, a great plague
broke out in the city. There were living in the house in Thames-street
the Alderman, his wife, his son, his son's wife, a daughter,
and his grandson, little Humphrey. On the first outbreak of the
pestilence they took counsel together and resolved that the child
should be first sent away to be out of danger, and that they would
follow if the plague spread.</p>

<p>This was done, and a sober man, one of their porters or warehousemen,
carried the child with his nurse all the way from London
to Bradford Orcas. Alas! Before the boy reached his great-uncle,
the house in Thames-street was attacked by the plague, and
everyone therein perished. Thus was poor little Humphrey deprived
of his parents. I know not who were his guardians or
trustees, or what steps, if any, were taken to inquire into the
Alderman's estate; but when, next year, the Great Fire of London
destroyed the house in Thames-street, with so many others, all the
estate, whatever it had been, vanished, and could no more be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
traced. There must have been large moneys owing. It is certain
that he had ventures in ships. It has been supposed that he owned
many houses in the City, but they were destroyed and their very
sites forgotten, and no deeds or papers, or any proof of ownership,
were left. Moreover, there was nobody charged with inquiring
into this orphan's affairs. Therefore, in the general confusion,
nothing at all was saved out of what had been a goodly property,
and the child Humphrey was left without a guinea in the world.
Thus unstable is Fortune.</p>

<p>I know not whether Humphrey received a fall in his infancy,
or whether he was born with his deformity, but the poor lad grew
up with a crooked figure, one shoulder being higher than the
other, and his legs short, so that he looked as if his arms were too
long for him. We, who saw him thus every day, paid no heed,
nor did he suffer from any of those cruel gibes and taunts which
are often passed upon lads thus afflicted. As he was by nature or
misfortune debarred from the rough sports which pleased his
cousins, the boy gave himself up to reading and study, and to
music. His manner of speech was soft and gentle; his voice was
always sweet, and afterwards became strong as well, so that I
have never heard a better singer. His face&mdash;ah! my brother
Humphrey, what a lovely face was thine! All goodness, surely,
was stamped upon that face. Never, never, did an unworthy
thought defile that candid soul, or a bad action cast a cloud upon
that brow!</p>

<p>As for Robin, Sir Christopher's grandson, I think he was always
what he is still, namely, one of a joyous heart and a cheerful
countenance. As a boy, he laughed continually, would sing more
willingly than read, would play rather than work, loved to course
and shoot and ride better than to learn Latin grammar, and would
readily off coat and fight with any who invited him. Yet not a
fool or a clown, but always a gentleman in manners, and one who
read such things as behove a country gentleman, and scrupulous
as to the point of honour. Such as he is still such he was always.
And of a comely presence, with a rosy cheek and bright eyes, and
the strength of a young David, as well as his ruddy and goodly
countenance. The name of David, I am told, means 'darling.'
Therefore ought my Robin to have been named David. There
were two other boys&mdash;Barnaby, my brother, who was six years
older than myself, and, therefore, always to me a great boy; and
Benjamin, the son of the Rev. Mr. Boscorel&mdash;the Rector. Barnaby
grew up so broad and strong that at twelve he would have passed
easily for seventeen; his square shoulders, deep chest, and big
limbs made him like a bull for strength. Yet he was shorter than
most, and looked shorter than he was by reason of his great breadth.
He was always exercising his strength; he would toss the hay with
the haymakers, and carry the corn for the reapers, and thresh with
the flail, and guide the plough. He loved to climb great trees, and
fell to them with an axe. Everybody in the village admired his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
wonderful strength. Unfortunately, he loved not books, and
could never learn anything, so that when, by dint of great application
and many repetitions, he had learned a little piece of a
Latin verb, he straightway forgot it in the night, and so, next day,
there was another flogging. But that he heeded little. He was
five years older than Robin, and taught him all his woodcraft&mdash;where
to find pheasants' eggs, how to catch squirrels, how to trap
weasels and stoats, how to hunt the otter, how to make a goldfinch
whistle and a raven talk&mdash;never was there such a master of that
wisdom which doth not advance a man in the world.</p>

<p>Now, before Barnaby's birth, his mother, after the manner of
Hannah, gave him solemnly unto the Lord all the days of his life,
and, after his birth, her husband, after the manner of Elkanah,
said: 'Do what seemeth thee good; only the Lord establish his
word.' He was, therefore, to become a minister, like his father
before him. Alas! poor Barnaby could not even learn the Latin
verbs, and his heart, it was found, as he grew older, was wholly
set upon the things of this world. Wherefore, my mother prayed
for him daily while she sat at her work, that his heart might be
turned, and that he might get understanding.</p>

<p>As for the fourth of the boys, Benjamin Boscorel, he was about
two years younger than Barnaby, a boy who, for want of a mother,
and because his father was careless of him, grew up rough and
coarse in manners and in speech, and boastful of his powers. To
hear Ben talk you would think that all the boys of his school (the
grammar school of Sherborne) were heroes; that the Latin taught
was of a quality superior to that which Robin and Humphrey learnt
of my father; and that when he himself went out into the world,
the superiority of his parts would be immediately perceived and
acknowledged.</p>

<p>Those who watch boys at play together&mdash;girls more early learn
to govern themselves and to conceal their thoughts, if not their
tempers&mdash;may, after a manner, predict the future character of
every one. There is the man who wants all for himself, and still
wants more, and will take all and yield nothing, save on compulsion,
and cares not a straw about his neighbour&mdash;such was Benjamin,
as a boy. There is the man who gives all generously&mdash;such
was Robin. There is, again, the man whose mind is raised above
the petty cares of the multitude, and dwells apart, occupied with
great thoughts&mdash;such was Humphrey. Lastly, there is the man
who can act but cannot think; who is born to be led; who is full
of courage and of strength, and leaves all to his commander,
captain, or master&mdash;such was Barnaby.</p>

<p>As I think of these lads it seems as if the kind of man into
which each would grow must have been stamped upon their
foreheads. Perhaps to the elders this prognostic was easy to
read.</p>

<p>They suffered me to play with them or to watch them at play.
When the boys went off to the woods I went with them. I watched<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
them set their traps&mdash;I ran when they ran. And then, as now, I
loved Robin and Humphrey. But I could not endure&mdash;no; not
even the touch of him&mdash;Benjamin, with the loud laugh and the
braggart voice, who laughed at me because I was a girl and could
not fight. The time came when he did not laugh at me because I
was a girl. And oh! to think&mdash;only to think&mdash;of the time that
came after that!</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV.</h2>

<h3>SIR CHRISTOPHER.</h3>


<div class="drop">
<img src="images/i_033.jpg" alt="A" width="100" height="101" class="cap" />
 <p class="cap_1">At the mere remembrance of Sir Christopher, I am fain
to lay down my pen and to weep, as for one whose
goodness was unsurpassed, and whose end was undeserved.
Good works, I know, are rags, and men
cannot deserve the mercy of God by any merits
of their own; but a good man&mdash;a man whose heart is full of
justice, mercy, virtue, and truth&mdash;is so rare a creature, that when
there is found such a one, his salvation seems assured. Is it
not wonderful that there are among us so many good Christians,
but so few good men? I am, indeed, in private duty bound
to acknowledge Sir Christopher's goodness to me and to mine.
He was, as I have said, the mainstay of our household. Had we
depended wholly on my mother's work, we should sometimes have
fared miserably indeed. Nay, he did more. Though a Justice of
the Peace, he invited my father every Sunday evening to the
Manor House for spiritual conversation, not only for his own profit,
but knowing that to expound was to my father the breath of his
nostrils, so that if he could not expound he must die. In person,
Sir Christopher was tall; after the fashion (which I love) of the
days when he was a young man he wore his own hair, which, being
now white and long, became his venerable face much better than
any wig&mdash;white, black, or brown. He was generally dressed, as
became his station of simple country gentleman, in a plush coat
with silver buttons, and for the most part he wore boots, being
of an active habit and always walking about his fields or in his
gardens among his flowers and his fruit-trees. He was so good a
sportsman that with his rod, his gun, and his hawk he provided
his table with everything except beef, mutton, and pork. In
religion he inclined to Independency, being above all things an
upholder of private judgment; in politics, he denied the Divine
right, and openly said that a Challis might be a King as well as a
Stuart; he abhorred the Pope and all his works; and though he
was now for a Monarchy, he would have the King's own power
limited by the Parliament. In his manners he was grave and
dignified; not austere, but one who loved a cheerful companion.
He rode once a week, on market day, to Sherborne, where he
dined with his brother Justices, hearing and discussing the news,
though news comes but slowly from London to these parts&mdash;it was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
fourteen days after the landing of the King in the year 1660
that the bells of Sherborne Minster rang for that event. Sometimes
a copy of the <cite>London Gazette</cite> came down by the Exeter
coach, or some of the company had lately passed a night where the
coach stopped, and conversed with travellers from London and
heard the news. For the rest of the week, his Honour was at
home. For the most part he sat in the hall. In the middle stands
the great oak table where all the household sit at meals together.
There was little difference between the dishes served above and
those below the salt, save that those above had each a glass of
strong ale or of wine after dinner and supper. One side of the
hall was hung with arras worked with representations of herbs,
beasts and birds. On the other side was the great chimney, where
in the winter a noble fire was kept up all day long. On either
side of it hung fox skins, otter skins, pole-cat skins, with fishing-rods,
stags' heads, horns and other trophies of the chase. At
the end was a screen covered with old coats of mail, helmets,
bucklers, lances, pikes, pistols, guns with match-locks, and a
trophy of swords arranged in form of a star. Below the cornice
hung a row of leathern jerkins, black and dusty, which had
formerly been worn in place of armour by the common sort. In
the oriel window was a sloping desk, having on one side the Bible
and on the other Foxe's 'Book of Martyrs.' Below was a shelf
with other books, such as Vincent Wing's Almanack, King
Charles's 'Golden Rules,' 'Glanville on Apparitions,' the 'Complete
Justice,' and the 'Book of Farriery.' There was also in the
hall a great side-board, covered with Turkey work, pewter, brass,
and fine linen. In the cupboard below was his Honour's plate,
reported to be worth a great deal of money.</p>
</div>

<p>Sir Christopher sat in a high chair, curiously carved, with
arms and a triangular seat. It had belonged to the family for many
generations. Within reach of the chair was the tobacco-jar, his pipe,
and his favourite book&mdash;namely, 'The Gentleman's Academie:
or the Book of St. Albans, being a Work on Hunting, Hawking,
and Armorie,' by Dame Juliana Berners, who wrote it two hundred
and fifty years ago. Sir Christopher loved especially to read aloud
that chapter in which it is proved that the distinction between
gentleman and churl began soon after the Creation, when Cain
proved himself a churl, and Seth was created Gentleman and
Esquire or Armiger by Adam, his father. This distinction was
renewed after the Flood by Noah himself, a gentleman by lineal
descent from Seth. In the case of his sons, Ham was the churl,
and the other two were the gentlemen. I have sometimes thought
that, according to this author, all of us who are descended from
Shem or Japhet should be gentlemen, in which case there would
be no churl in Great Britain at all. But certainly there are many;
so that, to my poor thinking, Dame Juliana Berners must be
wrong.</p>

<p>There is, in addition to the great hall, the best parlour. But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
as this was never wanted, the door of it was never opened except
at cleaning time. Then, to be sure, one saw a room furnished
very grand, with chairs in Turkey work, and hung round with
family portraits. The men were clad in armour, as if they had
all been soldiers or commanders; the women were mostly dressed
as shepherdesses, with crooks in their hands and flowing robes.
In the garden was a long bowling green, where in summer Sir
Christopher took great pleasure in that ancient game: below the
garden was a broad fishpond, made by damming the stream: above
and below the pond there were trout, and in the pond were carp
and jack. A part of the garden was laid out for flowers, a part for
the still-room, and a part for fruit. I have never seen anywhere a
better ordered garden for the still-room. Everything grew therein
that the housewife wants: sweet cicely, rosemary, burnet, sweet
basil, chives, dill, clary, angelica, lipwort, tarragon, thyme and
mint; there were, as Lord Bacon, in his 'Essay on Gardens,'
would have, 'whole alleys of them to have the pleasure when you
walk or tread.' There were thick hedges to keep off the east wind
in spring, so that one would enjoy the sun when that cold wind was
blowing. But in Somerset that wind hath not the bitterness that
it possesses along the eastern shores of the land.</p>

<p>Every morning Sir Christopher sat in his Justice's chair under
the helmets and the coats of armour. Sometimes gipsies would be
brought before him, charged with stealing poultry or poisoning
pigs; or a rogue and vagabond would stray into the parish; these
gentry were very speedily whipped out of it. As for our own
people, there is nowhere a more quiet and orderly village; quarrels
there are with the clothiers' men, who will still try to beat down the
value of the women's work, and bickerings sometimes between the
women themselves. Sir Christopher was judge for all. Truly he
was a patriarch like unto Abraham, and a father to his people.
Never was sick man suffered to want for medicines and succour;
never was aged man suffered to lack food and fire; did any youth
show leanings towards sloth, profligacy, or drunkenness, he was
straightway admonished, and that right soundly, so that his back
and shoulders would remind him for many days of his sin. By
evildoers Sir Christopher was feared as much as he was beloved by
all good men and true. This also is proper to one in high station
and authority.</p>

<p>In the evening he amused himself in playing backgammon with
the boys, or chess with his son-in-law, Mr. Boscorel: but the latter
with less pleasure, because he was generally defeated in the game.
He greatly delighted in the conversation and society of that learned
and ingenious gentleman, though on matters of religion and of
politics his son-in-law belonged to the opposite way of thinking.</p>

<p>I do not know why Mr. Boscorel took upon himself holy orders.
God forbid that I should speak ill of any in authority, and especially
of one who was kind and charitable to all, and refused to become a
persecutor of those who desired freedom of conscience and of speech.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
But if the chief duty of a minister of the Gospel is to preach, then
was Mr. Boscorel little better than a dog who cannot bark. He did
not preach; that is to say, he could not, like my father, mount the
pulpit, Bible in hand, and teach, admonish, argue, and convince
without a written word. He read every Sunday morning a brief
discourse, which might, perhaps, have instructed Oxford scholars,
but would not be understood by the common people. As for arguments
on religion, spiritual conversation, or personal experience of
grace, he would never suffer such talk in his presence, because it
argued private judgment and caused, he said, the growth of spiritual
pride. And of those hot Gospellers whose zeal brings them to
prison and the pillory, he spoke with contempt. His conversation,
I must acknowledge, was full of delight and instruction, if the things
which one learned of him were not vanities. He had travelled in
Italy and in France, and he loved to talk of poetry, architecture,
statuary, medals and coins, antiquities and so forth&mdash;things harmless
and, perhaps, laudable in themselves, but for a preacher of the
Gospel who ought to think of nothing but his sacred calling they are
surely superfluities. Or he would talk of the manners and customs
of strange countries, and especially of the Pope. This person,
whom I have been taught to look upon as from the very nature of
his pretensions the most wicked of living men, Mr. Boscorel regarded
with as much toleration as he bestowed upon an Independent.
Then he would tell us of London and the manners of the great; of
the King, whom he had seen, and the Court, seeming to wink at
things which one ought to hold in abhorrence. He even told us
of the playhouse, which, according to my father, is the most subtle
engine ever invented by the Devil for the destruction of souls. Yet
Mr. Boscorel sighed to think that he could no longer visit that
place of amusement. He loved also music, and played movingly
upon the violoncello; and he could make pictures with pen, pencil,
or brush. I have some of his paintings still, especially a picture
which he drew of Humphrey playing the fiddle, his great eyes looking
upwards as if the music was drawing his soul to Heaven. I
know not why he painted a halo about his face. Mr. Boscorel also
loved poetry, and quoted Shakspeare and Ben Jonson more readily
than the Word of God.</p>

<p>In person he was of a goodly countenance, having clear-cut
features: a straight nose, rather long; soft eyes, and a gentle
voice. He was dainty in his apparel, loving fine clean linen and
laced neckerchiefs, but was not a gross feeder; he drank but little
wine, but would discourse upon fine wines, such as the Tokay of
Hungary, Commandery wine from Cyprus, and the like, and he
seemed better pleased to watch the colour of the wine in the glass,
and to breathe its perfume, than to drink it. Above all things he
hated coarse speech and rude manners. He spoke of men as if he
stood on an eminence watching them, and always with pity, as if
he belonged to a nobler creation. How could such a man have
such a son?</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V.</h2>

<h3>THE RUNAWAY.</h3>
<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 216px;">
<img src="images/i_037.jpg" width="216" height="350" alt="everybody" />
</div>

<p>Everybody hath heard, and old people
still remember, how one
Act after the other was
passed for the suppression
of the Nonconformists,
whom the Church of England
tried to extirpate, but
could not. Had these laws
been truly carried into
effect, there would have been
great suffering among the
Dissenters; but, in order to
enforce them, every man's
hand would have been turned
against his neighbour, and
this&mdash;thank God!&mdash;is not
possible in Somerset. For example,
the Act of Uniformity
provided not only for the ejectment
of the Nonconforming ministers
(which was duly carried out),
but also enacted that none of them
should take scholars without the
license of the Bishop. Yet many of
the ejected ministers maintained themselves
in this way openly, without the Bishop's
license. They were not molested, though
they might be threatened by some hot
Episcopalian; nor were the Bishops anxious to set the country
afire by attempting to enforce this law. One must not take from
an honest neighbour, whatever an unjust law may command, his
only way of living.</p>

<p>Again, the Act passed two years later punished all persons with
fine and imprisonment who attended conventicles. Yet the conventicles
continued to be held over the whole country, because it
was impossible for the Justices to fine and imprison men with
whom they sat at dinner every market-day, with whom they took
their punch and tobacco, and whom they knew to be honest and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
God-fearing folk. Again, how could they fine and imprison their
own flesh and blood? Why, in every family there were some who
loved the meeting-house better than the steeple-house. Laws have
little power when they are against the conscience of the people.</p>

<p>Thirdly, there was an Act prohibiting ministers from residing
within five miles of the village or town where they had preached.
This was a most cruel and barbarous Act, because it sent the poor
ministers away from the help of their friends. Yet how was it
regarded? My father, for his part, continued to live at Bradford
Orcas without let or hindrance, and so, no doubt, did many more.</p>

<p>Again, another Act was passed giving authority to Justices of
the Peace to break open doors and to take in custody persons found
assembling for worship. I have heard of disturbances at Taunton,
where the Magistrates carried things with a high hand; but I
think the people who met to worship after their own fashion were
little disturbed. Among the Churchmen were some, no doubt,
who remembered the snubs and rubs they had themselves experienced,
and the memory may have made them revengeful. All the
persecution, it is certain, was not on the side of the Church.
There was, for instance, the case of Dr. Walter Raleigh, Dean of
Wells, who was clapped into a noisome prison where the plague
had broken out. He did not die of that disease, but was done to
death in the jail, barbarously, by one David Barrett, shoemaker,
who was never punished for the murder, but was afterwards made
Constable of the City. There was also the case of the Rev. Dr.
Piers, whom I have myself seen, for he lived to a good old age.
He was a Prebendary of Wells, and being driven forth, was compelled
to turn farmer, and to work with his own hands&mdash;digging,
hoeing, ploughing, reaping, and threshing&mdash;when he should have
been in his study. Every week this reverend and learned Doctor
of Divinity was to be seen at Ilminster Market, standing beside the
pillars with his cart, among the farmers and their wives, selling his
apples, cheese, and cabbages.</p>

<p>I say that no doubt many remembered these things. Yet the
affection of the people went forth to the Nonconformists and the
ejected ministers, as was afterwards but too well proved. I have
been speaking of things which happened before my recollection. It
was in the year 1665, four years after the Ejection, that I was
born. My father would have named me Grace Abounding, but my
mother called me Alice, after her own name. I was thus six years
younger than my brother Barnaby, and two years younger than
Robin and Humphrey.</p>

<p>The first thing that I can recollect is a kind of picture, preserved,
so to speak, in my head. At the open door is a woman
spinning at the wheel. She is a woman with a pale, grave face;
she works diligently, and for the most part in silence; if she speaks,
it is to encourage or to admonish a little girl who plays in the
garden outside. Her lips move as she works, because she communes
with her thoughts all day long. From time to time she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
turns her head and looks with anxiety into the other room, where
sits her husband at his table.</p>

<p>Before him stand three boys. They are Barnaby, Robin, and
Humphrey. They are learning Latin. The room is piled with
books on shelves and books on the floor. In the corner is a pallet,
which is the master's bed by night. I hear the voices of the boys
who repeat their lessons, and the admonishing of their master. I
can see through the open door the boys themselves. One, a stout
and broad lad, is my brother Barnaby: he hangs his head and
forgets his lesson, and causes his father to punish him every day.
He receives admonition with patience; yet profiteth nothing. The
next is Humphrey; he is already a lad of grave and modest
carriage, who loves his book and learns diligently. The third is
Robin, whose parts are good, were his application equal to his
intelligence. He is impatient, and longs for the time when he may
close his book and go to play again.</p>

<p>Poor Barnaby! at the sight of a Latin Grammar he would feel
sick. He would willingly have taken a flogging every day&mdash;to be
sure, that generally happened to him&mdash;in order to escape his lessons
and be off to the fields and woods.</p>

<p>It was the sight of his rueful face&mdash;yet never sad except at
lessons&mdash;which made my mother sigh when she saw him dull but
patient over his book. Had he stayed at home I know not what
could have been done with him, seeing that to become a preacher
of the Gospel was beyond even the power of prayer (the Lord having
clearly expressed His will in this matter). He would have had to
clap on a leathern apron, and become a wheelwright or blacksmith;
nothing better than an honest trade was possible for him.</p>

<p>But (whether happily or not) a strange whim seized the boy
when he was fourteen years of age. He would go to sea. How he
came to think of the sea I know not; he had never seen the sea;
there were no sailors in the village; there was no talk of the sea.
Perhaps Humphrey, who read many books, told him of the great
doings of our sailors on the Spanish Main and elsewhere. Perhaps
some of the clothiers' men, who are a roving and unsettled crew,
had been sailors&mdash;some, I know, had been soldiers under Oliver.
However, this matters not, Barnaby must needs become a sailor.</p>

<p>When first he broke this resolution, which he did secretly, to
my mother, she began to weep and lament, because everybody
knows how dreadful is the life of a sailor, and how full of dangers.
She begged him to put the thought out of his head, and to apply
himself again to his books.</p>

<p>'Mother,' he said, 'it is no use. What comes in at one ear
goes out at the other. Nothing sticks: I shall never be a scholar.'</p>

<p>'Then, my son, learn an honest trade.'</p>

<p>'What? Become the village cobbler&mdash;or the blacksmith? Go
hat in hand to his Honour, when my father should have been a
Bishop, and my mother is a gentlewoman? That will I not. I will
go and be a sailor. All sailors are gentlemen. I shall rise and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
become first mate, and then second captain, and lastly, captain in
command. Who knows? I may go and fight the Spaniard, if I
am lucky.'</p>

<p>'Oh, my son, canst thou not stay at home and go to church,
and consider the condition of thine immortal soul? Of sailors it
is well known that their language is made up of profane oaths,
and that they are all profligates and drunkards. Consider, my son'&mdash;my
mother laid her hand upon his arm&mdash;'what were Heaven to
me, if I have not my dear children with me as well as my husband?
How could I praise the Lord if I were thinking of my son who was
not with me, but&mdash;ah! Heaven forbid the thought!'</p>

<p>Barnaby made no reply. What could he say in answer to my
mother's tears? Yet I think she must have understood very well
that her son, having got this resolution into his head, would never
give it up.</p>

<p>'Oh!' she said, 'when thou wast a little baby in my arms,
Barnaby&mdash;who art now so big and strong'&mdash;she looked at him with
the wonder and admiration that women feel when their sons grow
big and stout&mdash;'I prayed that God would accept thee as an offering
for His service. Thou art vowed unto the Lord, my son, as
much as Samuel. Do you think he complained of his lessons?
What would have happened, think you, to Samuel if he had taken off
his ephod and declared that he would serve no longer at the altar,
but must take spear and shield, and go to fight the Amalekite?'</p>

<p>Said Barnaby, in reply, speaking from an unregenerate heart,
'Mother, had I been Samuel, to wear an ephod and to learn the
Latin syntax every day, I should have done that. Ay! I would
have done it, even if I knew that at the first skirmish an arrow
would pierce my heart.'</p>

<p>It was after a great flogging, on account of the passive voice or
some wrestling with the syntax, that Barnaby plucked up courage
to tell his father what he wished to do.</p>

<p>'With my consent,' said my father, sternly, 'thou shalt never
become a sailor. As soon would I send thee to become a buffoon
in a playhouse. Never dare to speak of it again.'</p>

<p>Barnaby hung his head and said nothing.</p>

<p>Then my mother, who knew his obstinate disposition, took him
to Sir Christopher, who chid him roundly, telling him that there
was work for him on land, else he would have been born beside
the coast, where the lads take naturally to the sea: that being, as
he was, only an ignorant boy, and landborn, he could not know
the dangers which he would encounter: that some ships are cast
away on desert islands, where the survivors remain in misery until
they die, and some on lands where savages devour them, and some
are dragged down by calamaries and other dreadful monsters, and
some are burned at sea, their crews having to choose miserably
between burning and drowning, and some are taken by the enemy,
and the sailors clapped into dungeons and tortured by the Accursed
Inquisition.</p>

<div class="caption"><p class="center">'<i>He was seized with a mighty wrath, and, catching his son sharply
by the ear, led him out of the throng.</i>'</p></div>
</div>



<p>Many more things did Sir Christopher set forth, showing the
miserable life and the wretched end of the sailor. But Barnaby
never changed countenance, and though my mother bade him
note this and mark that, and take heed unto his Honour's words,
his face showed no melting. 'Twas always an obstinate lad;
nay it was his obstinacy alone which kept him from his learning.
Otherwise he might perhaps have become as great a scholar as
Humphrey.</p>

<p>'Sir,' he said, when Sir Christopher had no other word to say,
'with submission, I would still choose to be a sailor, if I could.'</p>

<p>In the end he obtained his wish. That is to say, since no one
would help him towards it, he helped himself. And this, I think,
is the only way in which men do ever get what they want.</p>

<p>It happened one evening that there passed through the village
a man with a pipe and tabor, on which he played so movingly that
all the people turned out to listen. For my own part I was with
my mother, yet I ran to the garden-gate and leaned my head over,
drawn by the sound of the music. Presently the boys and girls
began to take hands together and to dance. I dare not say that
to dance is sinful, because David danced. But it was so regarded
by my father, so that when he passed by them, on his way home
from taking the air, and actually saw his own son Barnaby in the
middle of the dancers, footing it merrily with them all, joyfully
leading one girl up and the other down at <em>John come and kiss me
now</em>, he was seized with a mighty wrath, and, catching his son
sharply by the ear, led him out of the throng and so home. For
that evening Barnaby went supperless to bed, with the promise of
such a flogging in the morning as would cause him to remember
for the rest of his life the sinfulness of dancing. Never had I
seen my father so angry. I trembled before his wrathful eyes.
But Barnaby faced him with steady looks, making answer none,
yet not showing the least repentance or fear. I thought it was
because a flogging had no terrors for him. The event proved that
I was wrong; that was not the reason: he had resolved to run
away, and when we awoke in the morning he was gone. He had
crept down-stairs in the night; he had taken half a loaf of bread
and a great cantle of soft cheese, and had gone away. He had not
gone for fear of the rod: he had run away with design to go to
sea. Perhaps he had gone to Bristol; perhaps to Plymouth;
perhaps to Lyme. My mother wept, and my father sighed; and
for ten years more we neither saw nor heard anything of Barnaby,
not even whether he was dead or living.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI.</h2>

<h3>BENJAMIN, LORD CHANCELLOR.</h3>


<div class="drop">
<img src="images/i_044.jpg" alt="S" width="100" height="99" class="cap" />
 <p class="cap_1">Summer follows winter and winter summer, in due
course, turning children into young men and maidens,
changing school into work, and play into love, and
love into marriage, and so onwards to the churchyard,
where we all presently lie, hopeful of Heaven's mercy,
whether Mr. Boscorel did stand beside our open grave in his white
surplice, or my father in his black gown.</p>
</div>

<p>Barnaby was gone; the other three grew tall, and would still
be talking of the lives before them. Girls do never look forward
to the future with the eagerness and joy of boys. To the dullest
boy it seems a fine thing to be master of his own actions, even if
that liberty lead to whipping-post, pillory, or gallows. To boys
of ambition and imagination the gifts of Fortune show like the
splendid visions of a prophet. They think that earthly fame will
satisfy the soul. Perhaps women see these glories and their true
worth with clearer eye as not desiring them. And truly it seems
a small thing, after a life spent in arduous toil, and with one foot
already in the grave, to obtain fortune, rank, or title.</p>

<p>Benjamin and Humphrey were lads of ambition. To both, but
in fields which lay far apart, the best life seemed to be that which
is spent among men on the ant-hill where all are driving or being
driven, loading each other with burdens intolerable, or with wealth
or with honours, and then dying and being forgotten in a moment&mdash;which
we call London. In the kindly country one stands apart
and sees the vanity of human wishes. Teat the ambition of Humphrey,
it must be confessed, was noble, because it was not for his
own advancement, but for the good of mankind.</p>

<p>'I shall stay at home,' said Robin. 'You two may go if you
please. Perhaps you will like the noise of London, where a man
cannot hear himself speak, they say, for the roaring of the crowd,
the ringing of the bells, and the rumbling of the carts. As for me,
what is good enough for my grandfather will be surely good enough
for me.'</p>

<p>It should, indeed, be good enough for anybody to spend his
days after the manner of Sir Christopher, administering justice for
the villagers, with the weekly ordinary at Sherborne for company,
the green fields and his garden for pleasure and for exercise, and
the welfare of his soul for prayer. Robin, besides, loved to go<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
forth with hawk and gun; to snare the wild creatures; to hunt the
otter and the fox; to bait the badger, and trap the stoat and weasel;
to course the hares. But cities and crowds, even if they should be
shouting in his honour, did never draw him, even after he had seen
them. Nor was he ever tempted to believe any manner of life more
full of delight and more consistent with the end of man's creation
than the rural life, the air of the fields, the following of the plough
for the men, and the spinning-wheel for the women.</p>

<p>'I shall be a lawyer,' said Benjamin, puffing out his cheeks and
squaring his shoulders. 'Very well, then, I say I shall be a great
lawyer. What? None of your pettifogging tribe for me: I shall
step to the front, and stay there. What? Someone must have the
prizes and the promotion. There are always places falling vacant
and honours to be given away: they shall be given to me. Why
not to me as well as another?'</p>

<p>'Well,' said Robin, 'you are strong enough to take them, willy-nilly.'</p>

<p>'I am strong enough,' he replied, with conviction. 'First, I
shall be called to the Outer Bar, where I shall plead in stuff&mdash;I saw
them at Exeter last 'Sizes. Next, I shall be summoned to become
King's Counsel, when I shall flaunt it in silk. Who but I?' Then
he seemed to grow actually three inches taller, so great is the
power of imagination. He was already six feet in height, his
shoulders broad, and his face red and fiery, so that now he looked
very big and tall. 'Then my Inn will make me a Bencher, and I
shall sit at the high table in term-time. And the attorneys shall
run after me and fight with each other for my services in Court, so
that in every great case I shall be heard thundering before the jury,
and making the witnesses perjure themselves with terror&mdash;for
which they will be afterwards flogged. I shall belong to the King's
party&mdash;none of your canting Whigs for me. When the high treason
cases come on, I shall be the counsel for the Crown. That is
the high road to advancement.'</p>

<p>'This is very well, so far,' said Robin, laughing. 'Ben is too
modest, however. He does not get on fast enough.'</p>

<p>'All in good time,' Ben replied. 'I mean to get on as fast as
anybody. But I shall follow the beaten road. First, favour with
attorneys and those who have suits in the Courts; then the ear of
the Judge. I know not how one gets the ear of the Judge'&mdash;he
looked despondent for a moment, then he held up his head again&mdash;'but
I shall find out. Others have found out&mdash;why not I? What?
I am no fool, am I?'</p>

<p>'Certainly not, Ben. But as yet we stick at King's Counsel.'</p>

<p>'After the ear of the Judge, the favour of the Crown. What do
I care who is King? It is the King who hath preferment and place
and honours in his gift. Where these are given away, there shall
I be found. Next am I made Serjeant-at-Law. Then I am saluted
as 'Brother' by the Judges on the Bench, while all the others burst
with envy. After that I shall myself be called to the Bench. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
am already "my Lord"&mdash;why do you laugh, Robin?&mdash;and a
Knight: Sir Benjamin Boscorel&mdash;Sir Benjamin.' Here he puffed
out his cheeks again, and swung his shoulders like a very great
person indeed.</p>

<p>'Proceed, Sir Benjamin,' said Humphrey, gravely, while Robin
laughed.</p>

<p>'When I am a Judge, I promise you I will rate the barristers
and storm at the witnesses and admonish the Jury until there shall
be no other question in their minds but to find out first what is my
will in the case, and then to govern themselves accordingly. I will
be myself Judge and jury and all. Oh! I have seen the Judge at last
Exeter 'Sizes. He made all to shake in their shoes. I shall not
stop there. Chief Baron I shall be, perhaps&mdash;but on that point I
have not yet made up my mind&mdash;and then Lord Chancellor.' He
paused to take breath, and looked around him, grandeur and
authority upon his brow. 'Lord Chancellor,' he repeated, 'on the
Woolsack!'</p>

<p>'You will then,' said Robin, 'be raised to the peerage&mdash;first
Lord Boscorel; or perhaps, if your Lordship will so honour this
poor village, Lord Bradford Orcas'&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>'Earl of Sherborne I have chosen for title,' said Benjamin.
'And while I am climbing up the ladder, where wilt thou be,
Humphrey? Grovelling in the mud with the poor devils who
cannot rise?'</p>

<p>'Nay, I shall have a small ladder of my own, Ben. I find great
comfort in the thought that when your Lordship is roaring and bawling
with the gout&mdash;your noble toe being like a ball of fire, and your
illustrious foot swathed in flannel&mdash;I shall be called upon to drive
away the pain, and you will honour me with the title not only of
humble cousin, but also of rescuer and preserver. Will it not be
honour enough to cure the Right Honourable the Earl of Sherborne
(first of the name), the Lord Chancellor, of his gout, and to restore
him to the duties of his great office, so that once more he shall be
the dread of evildoers and of all who have to appear before him?
As yet, my Lord, your extremities, I perceive, are free from that
disease&mdash;the result, too often, of that excess in wine which besets
the great.'</p>

<p>Here Robin laughed again, and so did Benjamin. Nobody
could use finer language than Humphrey, if he pleased.</p>

<p>'A fine ambition!' said Ben. 'To wear a black velvet coat and
a great wig; to carry a gold-headed cane; all day long to listen
while the patient tells of his gripes and pains; to mix boluses, and
to compound nauseous draughts!'</p>

<p>'Well,' Humphrey laughed, 'if you are Lord Chancellor, Ben,
you will, I hope, give us good laws, and so make the nation happy
and prosperous. While you are doing this, I will be keeping you
in health for the good of the country. I say that this is a fine
ambition.'</p>

<p>'And Robin, here, will sit in the great chair, and have the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
rogues haled before him, and order the Head-borough to bring out
his cat-o'-nine-tails. In the winter evenings, he will play backgammon,
and in the summer, bowls. Then a posset, and to bed.
And never any change from year to year. A fine life, truly!'</p>

<p>'Truly, I think it is a very fine life,' said Robin; 'while you
make the laws, I will take care that they are obeyed. What better
service is there than to cause good laws to be obeyed? Make good
laws, my Lord Chancellor, and be thankful that you will have
faithful, law-abiding men to carry them out.'</p>

<p>Thus they talked. Presently the time came when the lads
must leave the village and go forth to prepare for such course as
should be allotted to them, whether it led to greatness or to
obscurity.</p>

<p>Benjamin went first, being sixteen years of age and a great
fellow, as I have said, broad-shouldered and lusty, with a red face,
a strong voice, and a loud laugh. In no respect did he resemble his
father, who was delicate in manner and in speech. He was to be
entered at Gray's Inn, where, under some counsel learned in the
law, he was to read until such time as he should be called.</p>

<p>He came to bid me farewell, which at first, until he frightened
me with the things he said, I took kindly of him.</p>

<p>'Child,' he said, 'I am going to London, and, I suppose, I
shall not come back to this village for a long time. Nay, were it
not for thee, I should not wish to come back at all.'</p>

<p>'Why for me, Ben?'</p>

<p>'Because'&mdash;here his red face became redder, and he stammered a
little, but not much, for he was ever a lad of confidence&mdash;'because,
child, thou art not yet turned twelve, which is young to be hearing
of such a thing. Yet a body may as well make things safe. And
as for Humphrey or Robin interfering, I will break their heads
with my cudgel if they do. Remember that, then.' He shook his
finger at me, threatening.</p>

<p>'In what business should they interfere?' I asked.</p>

<p>'Kiss me, Alice'&mdash;here he tried to lay his arm round my neck,
but I ran away. 'Oh! if thou art skittish, I care not: all in good
time. Very well, then; let us make things safe. Alice, when I
come back thou wilt be seventeen or eighteen, which is an age
when girls should marry'&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>'I have nothing to do with marrying, Ben.'</p>

<p>'Not yet. If I mistake not, child, thou wilt then be as beautiful
as a rose in June.'</p>

<p>'I want no foolish talk, Ben. Let me go.'</p>

<p>'Then I shall be twenty-one years of age, practising in the
courts. I shall go the Western Circuit, in order to see thee often&mdash;partly
to keep an eye upon thee and partly to warn off other men.
Because, child, it is my purpose to marry thee myself. Think upon
that, now.'</p>

<p>At this I laughed.</p>

<p>'Laugh if you please, my dear; I shall marry thee as soon as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
the way is open to the Bench and the Woolsack. What? I can see
a long way ahead. I will tell thee what I see. There is a monstrous
great crowd of people in the street staring at a glass coach. "Who
is the lovely lady?" they ask. "The lovely lady"&mdash;that is you,
Alice; none other&mdash;"with the diamonds at her neck and the gold
chain, in the glass coach?" says one who knows her liveries: "'tis
the lady of the great Lord Chancellor, the Earl of Sherborne."
And the women fall green with envy of her happiness and great
good fortune and her splendour. Courage, child: I go to prepare
the way. Oh! thou knowest not the grand things that I shall pour
into thy lap when I am a judge.'</p>

<p>This was the first time that any man spoke to me of love. But
Benjamin was always masterful, and had no respect for such a
nice point as the wooing of a maiden&mdash;which, methinks, should be
gentle and respectful, not as if a woman was like a savage to be
tempted by a string of beads, or so foolish as to desire with her
husband such gauds as diamonds, or gold chains, or a glass coach.
Nor doth a woman like to be treated as if she was to be carried off
by force like the Sabine women of old.</p>

<p>The Rector rode to London with his son. It is a long journey,
over rough ways; but it pleased him once more to see that great
city, where there are pictures and statues and books to gladden the
hearts of such as love these things. And on the way home he
sojourned for a few days at his old college of All Souls, where were
still left one or two of his old friends. Then he rode back to his
village. 'There are but two places in this country,' he said, 'or
perhaps three, at most, where a gentleman and a scholar, or one
who loveth the fine arts, would choose to live. These are London
and Oxford, and perhaps the Sister University upon the Granta.
Well, I have once more been privileged to witness the humours of
the Court and the town: I have once more been permitted to sniff
the air of a great library. Let us be thankful.' He showed his
thankfulness with a sigh which was almost a groan.</p>

<p>It was three years before we saw Benjamin again. Then he
returned, but not for long. Like his father, he loved London
better than the country, but for other reasons. Certainly, he
cared nothing for those arts which so much delighted the Rector,
and the air of a coffee-house pleased him more than the perfume of
books in a library. When he left us he was a rustic; when he
came back he was already what they call a fopling: that is to say,
when he went to pay his respects to Sir Christopher, his grandfather,
he wore a very fine cravat of Flanders lace, with silken
hose, and lace and ribbons at his wrist. He was also scented with
bergamot, and wore a peruke, which, while he talked, he combed
and curled, to keep the curls of this monstrous head-dress in place.
Gentlemen must, I suppose, wear this invention, and one of the
learned professions must show the extent of the learning by the
splendours of his full-bottomed wig. Yet I think that a young
man looks most comely while he wears his own hair. He had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
cocked his hat, on which were bows of riband, and he wore a
sword. He spoke also in a mincing London manner, having
now forsworn the honest broad speech of Somerset; and (but not
in the presence of his elders) he used strange oaths and ejaculations.</p>

<p>'Behold him!' said his father, by no means displeased at his
son's foppery, because he ever loved the city fashions, and thought
that a young man did well to dress and to comport himself after the
way of the world. 'Behold him! Thus he sits in the coffee-house;
thus he shows himself in the pit. Youth is the time for finery and
for folly. Alas! would that we could bring back that time! What
saith John Dryden&mdash;glorious John&mdash;of Sir Fopling?&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'"His various modes from various fathers follow:</span>
<span class="i1">One taught the toss, and one the new French wallow;</span>
<span class="i1">His sword-knot this, his cravat that, designed,</span>
<span class="i1">And this the yard-long snake he twirls behind.</span>
<span class="i1">From one the sacred periwig he gained,</span>
<span class="i1">Which wind ne'er blew, nor touch of hat profaned."</span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>'Well, Ben,' said Sir Christopher, 'if the mode can help thee
to the Bench why not follow the mode?'</p>

<p>'It will not hinder, Sir,' Ben replied. 'A man who hath his
fortune to make does well to be seen everywhere, and to be dressed
like other men of his time.'</p>

<p>One must do Benjamin the justice to acknowledge that though,
like the young gentlemen his friends and companions, his dress
was foppish, and his talk was of the pleasures of the town, he
suffered nothing to stand in the way of his advancement. He was
resolved upon being a great lawyer, and, therefore, if he spent the
evening in drinking, singing, and making merry, he was reading in
chambers or else attending the Courts all the day, and neglected
nothing that would make him master of his profession. And,
though of learning he had little, his natural parts were so good,
and his resolution was so strong, that I doubt not he would have
achieved his ambition had it not been for the circumstances
which afterwards cut short his career. His course of life, by his
own boastful confession, was profligate; his friends were drinkers
and revellers; his favourite haunt was the tavern, where they all
drank punch and sang ungodly songs, and smoked tobacco; and of
religion he seemed to have no care whatever.</p>

<p>I was afraid that he would return to the nauseous subject which
he had opened three years before. Therefore I continued with
my mother, and would give him no chance to speak with me. But
he found me, and caught me returning home one evening.</p>

<p>'Alice,' he said, 'I feared that I might have to go away without
a word alone with thee.'</p>

<p>'I want no words alone, Benjamin. Let me pass!' For he
stood before me in the way.</p>

<p>'Not so fast, pretty!'&mdash;he caught me by the wrist, and, being
a young man so strong and determined, he held me as by a vice.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
'Not so fast, Mistress Alice. First, my dear, let me tell thee that
my purpose still holds&mdash;nay'&mdash;here he swore a most dreadful, impious
oath&mdash;'I am more resolved than ever. There is not a woman,
even in London, that is to be compared with thee, child. What?
Compared with thee? Why, they are like the twinkling stars compared
with the glorious Queen of Night. What did I say?&mdash;that
at nineteen thou wouldst be a miracle of beauty? Nay, that time
hath come already! I love thee, child! I love thee, I say, ten
times as much as ever I loved thee before!'</p>

<p>He gasped, and then breathed hard; but still he held me fast.</p>

<p>'Idle compliments cost a man nothing, Benjamin. Say what
you meant to say and let me go. If you hold me any longer I will
cry out and bring your father to learn the reason.'</p>

<p>'Well,' he said, 'I will not keep thee. I have said what I
wanted to say. My time hath not yet arrived. I am shortly to be
called, and shall then begin to practise. When I come back here
again, 'twill be with a ring in one hand, and in the other the prospect
of the Woolsack. Think upon that while I am gone. "Your
Ladyship" is finer than plain "Madam," and the Court is more
delightful than a village green among the pigs and ducks. Think
upon it well: thou art a lucky girl; a plain village girl to be promoted
to a coronet! However, I have no fears for thee; thou wilt
adorn the highest fortune. Thou wilt be worthy of the great place
whither I shall lead thee. What? Is Sir George Jeffreys a better
man than I? Is he of better family? Had he better interest? Is
he a bolder man? Not so. Yet was Sir George a Common Serjeant
at twenty-three, and Recorder at thirty; Chief Justice of
Chester at thirty-two. What he hath done I can do. Moreover,
Sir George hath done me the honour to admit me to his company,
and will advance me. This he hath promised, both in his cups and
when he is sober. Think it over, child: a ring in one hand and a
title in the other.'</p>

<p>So Benjamin went away again. I was afraid when I thought of
him and his promise, because I knew him of old; and his eyes
were as full of determination as when he would fight a lad of his
own age and go on fighting till the other had had enough. Yet he
could not marry me against my will. His own father would protect
me, to say nothing of mine.</p>

<p>I should have told him then&mdash;as I had told him before&mdash;that I
would never marry him. Then, perhaps, he would have been
shaken in his purpose. The very thought of marrying him filled
me with terror unspeakable. I was afraid of him not only because
he was so masterful&mdash;nay, women like a man to be strong of will&mdash;but
because he had no religion in him and lived like an Atheist, if
such a wretch there be; at all events, with unconcern about his
soul; and because his life was profligate, his tastes were gross, and
he was a drinker of much wine. Even at the Manor House I had
seen him at supper drinking until his cheeks were puffed out and
his voice grew thick. What kind of happiness would there be for
a wife whose husband has to be carried home by his varlets, too<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
heavy with drink to stand or to speak?</p>

<p>Alas! there is one thing which girls, happily, do never apprehend.
They cannot understand how it is possible for a man to become
so possessed with the idea of their charms (which they hold
themselves as of small account, knowing how fleeting they are, and
of what small value) that he will go through fire and water for that
woman; yea, and break all the commandments, heedless of his
immortal soul, rather than suffer another man to take her&mdash;and
that, even though he knows that the poor creature loves him not,
or loves another man. If maidens knew this, I think that they would
go in fear and trembling lest they should be coveted by some wild
beast in human shape, and prove the death of the gallant gentleman
whom they would choose for their lover. Or they would make
for themselves convents and hide in them, so great would be their
fear. But it is idle to speak of this, because, say what one will,
girls can never understand the power and the vehemence of love,
when once it hath seized and doth thoroughly possess a man.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII.</h2>

<h3>MEDICINÃ† DOCTOR.</h3>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 202px;">
<img src="images/i_052.jpg" width="202" height="300" alt="Humphrey" />
</div>

<p>Humphrey did not, like Benjamin,
brag of the things he
would do when he should
go forth to the world.
Nevertheless, he thought
much about his future,
and frequently he discoursed with me
about the life that he fain would lead.
A young man, I think, wants someone
with whom he may speak freely concerning
the thoughts which fill his
soul. We who belong to the sex
which receives but does not create or
invent, which profits by man's good
work, and suffers from the evil which
he too often does, have no such
thoughts and ambitions.</p>

<p>'I cannot,' he would say, 'take
upon me holy orders, as Mr. Boscorel
would have me, promising, in my
cousin Robin's name, this living after
his death, because, though I am in
truth a mere pauper and dependent,
there are in me none of those prickings
of the spirit which I could interpret into a Divine
call for the ministry; next, because I cannot in conscience
swear to obey the Thirty-nine Articles while I still hold
that the Nonconformist way of worship is more consonant with the
Word of God. And, again, I am of opinion that the Law of
Moses, which forbade any but a well-formed man from serving at
the altar, hath in it something eternal. It denotes that as no
cripple may serve at the earthly altar, so in heaven, of which the
altar is an emblem, all those who dwell therein shall be perfect in
body as in soul. What, then, is such a one as myself, who hath
some learning and no fortune, to do? Sir Christopher, my benefactor,
will maintain me at Oxford until I have taken a degree.
This is more than I could have expected. Therefore, I am resolved<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
to take a degree in medicine. It is the only profession fit for a
mis-shapen creature. They will not laugh at me when I alleviate
their pains.'</p>

<p>'Could anyone laugh at you, Humphrey?'</p>

<p>'Pray heaven, I frighten not the ladies at the first aspect of
me.' He laughed, but not with merriment; for, indeed, a cripple
or a hunchback cannot laugh mirthfully over his own misfortune.
'Some men speak scornfully of the profession,' he went on. 'The
great French playwright, Monsieur MoliÃ¨re, doth make the physicians
the butt and laughing-stock of all Paris. Yet consider. It
is medicine which prolongs our days and relieves our pains. Before
the science was studied, the wretch who caught a fever in the
marshy forest lay down and died; an ague lasted all one's life; a
sore throat putrefied and killed; a rheumatism threw a man upon
the bed, from which he would never rise. The physician is man's
chief friend. If our Sovereigns studied the welfare of humanity
as deeply as the art of war, they would maintain, at vast expense,
great colleges of learned men continually engaged in discovering
the secrets of nature&mdash;the causes and the remedies of disease.
What better use can a man make of his life than to discover one&mdash;only
one&mdash;secret which will drive away part of the agony of disease?
The Jews, more merciful than the Romans, stupefied their criminals
after they were crucified; they died, indeed, but their sufferings
were less. So the physician, though in the end all men must
die, may help them to die without pain. Nay, I have even thought
that we might devise means of causing the patient by some potent
drug to fall into so deep a sleep that even the surgeon's knife shall
not cause him to awaken.'</p>

<p>He, therefore, before he entered at Oxford, read with my
father many learned books of the ancients on the science and practice
of medicine, and studied botany with the help of such books as
he could procure.</p>

<p>Some men have but one side to them&mdash;that is to say, the only
active part of them is engaged in but one study; the rest is given
up to rest or indolence. Thus Benjamin studied law diligently,
but nothing else. Humphrey, for his part, read his Galen and his
Celsus, but he neglected not the cultivation of those arts and accomplishments
in which Mr. Boscorel was as ready a teacher as he was
a ready scholar. He thus learned the history of painting, and
sculpture, and architecture, and that of coins and medals, so that
at eighteen Humphrey might already have set up as a virtuoso.</p>

<p>Nor was this all. Still, by the help of the Rector, he learned
the use of the pencil and the brush, and could both draw prettily,
or paint in water colours, whether the cottages or the church, the
cows in the fields, or the woods and hills. I have many pictures of
his painting which he gave me from time to time. And he could
play sweetly, whether on the spinnet, or the violin, or the guitar,
spending many hours every week with Mr. Boscorel playing duettos
together; and willingly he would sing, having a rich and full voice,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
very delightful to hear. When I grew a great girl, and had
advanced far enough, I was permitted to play with them. There
was no end to the music which Mr. Boscorel possessed. First, he
had a great store of English ditties such as country people love&mdash;as,
'Sing all a green willow,' 'Gather ye rosebuds while ye may,'
or 'Once I loved a maiden fair.' There was nothing rough or rude
in these songs, though I am informed that much wickedness is
taught by the ribald songs that are sung in playhouses and coffee-rooms.
And when we were not playing or singing, Mr. Boscorel
would read us poetry&mdash;portions from Shakspeare or Ben Jonson,
or out of Milton's 'Paradise Lost'; or from Herrick, who is surely
the sweetest poet that ever lived, 'yet marred,' said Mr. Boscorel,
'by his coarseness and corruption.' Now, one day, after we had
been thus reading&mdash;one winter afternoon, when the sun lay upon
the meadows&mdash;Humphrey walked home with me, and on the way
confessed, with many blushes, that he, too, had been writing verses.
And with that he lugged a paper out of his pocket.</p>

<p>'They are for thine own eyes only,' he said. 'Truly, my dear,
thou hast the finest eyes in the world. They are for no other eyes
than thine,' he repeated. 'Not for Robin, mind, lest he laugh:
poetry hath in it something sacred, so that even the writer of bad
verses cannot bear to have them laughed at. When thou art a year
or two older thou wilt understand that they were written for thy
heart as well as for thine eyes. Yet, if thou like the verses, they
may be seen by Mr. Boscorel, but in private; and if he laugh at
them do not tell me. Yet, again, one would like to know what he
said; wherefore, tell me, though his words be like a knife in my
side.'</p>

<p>Thus he wavered between wishing to show them to his master in
art, and fearing.</p>

<p>In the end, when I showed them to Mr. Boscorel, he said that,
for a beginner, they were very well&mdash;very well, indeed; that the
rhymes were correct, and the metre true; that years and practice
would give greater firmness, and that the crafty interlacing of
thought and passion, which was the characteristic of Italian verse,
could only be learned by much reading of the Italian poets. More
he said, speaking upon the slight subject of rhyme and poetry with
as much seriousness and earnestness as if he were weighing and
comparing texts of Scripture.</p>

<p>Then he gave me back the verses with a sigh.</p>

<p>'Child,' he said, 'to none of us is given what most we desire.
For my part, I longed in his infancy that my son should grow up
even as Humphrey, as quick to learn; with as true a taste; with
as correct an ear; with a hand as skilful. But&mdash;&mdash;you see, I complain
not, though Benjamin loves the noisy tavern better than the
quiet coffee-house where the wits resort. To him such things as
verses, art, and music are foolishness. I say that I complain not;
but I would to Heaven that Humphrey were my own, and that his
shoulders were straight, poor lad! Thy father hath made him a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
Puritan: he is such as John Milton in his youth&mdash;and as beautiful
in face as that stout Republican. I doubt not that we shall have
from the hand of Humphrey, if he live and prosper, something
fine, the nature of which, whether it is to be in painting, or in
music, or in poetry, I know not. Take the verses, and take care
that thou lose them not; and, child&mdash;remember&mdash;the poet is
allowed to say what he pleases about a woman's eyes. Be not
deceived into thinking&mdash;&mdash;But no&mdash;no&mdash;there is no fear. Good-night,
thou sweet and innocent saint.'</p>

<p>I knew not then what he meant; but these are the verses, and
I truly think that they are very moving and religious. For if
woman be truly the most beautiful work of the Creator (which all
men aver), then it behoves her all the more still to point upwards.
I read them with a pleasure and surprise that filled my whole soul,
and inflamed my heart with pious joy:&mdash;</p>

<p>When Humphrey went away, he did not, like Benjamin, come
blustering and declaring that he would marry me, and that he
would break the skull of any other man who dared make love to
me&mdash;not at all; Humphrey, with tears in his eyes, told me that
he was sorry I could not go to Oxford as well; that he was going
to lose the sweetest companion in the world; and that he should
always love me; and then he kissed me on the forehead, and so
departed. Why should he not always love me? I knew very well
that he loved me, and that I loved him. Although he was so
young, being only seventeen when he was entered at Exeter
College, I suppose there never was a young gentleman went to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
University of Oxford with so many accomplishments, and so much
learning. By my father's testimony he read Greek as if it were
his mother tongue, and he wrote and conversed easily in Latin:
and you have heard what arts and accomplishments he added to
this solid learning. He was elected to a scholarship at his college,
that of Exeter, and, after he took his degree as Bachelor of Medicine,
he was made a Fellow of All Souls, where Mr. Boscorel
himself had also been a Fellow. This election was not only a
great distinction for him, but it gave him what a learned young
man especially desires&mdash;the means of living and of pursuing his
studies.</p>

<p>While he was at Oxford he wrote letters to Sir Christopher, to
Mr. Boscorel, and to my father (to whom also he sent such new
books and pamphlets as he thought would interest him). To me
he sent sometimes drawings and sometimes books, but never
verses.</p>

<p>Now (to make an end of Humphrey for the present), when he
had obtained his fellowship, he asked for and obtained leave of
absence and permission to study medicine in those great schools
which far surpass, they say, our English schools of medicine.
These are that of Montpellier; the yet more famous school of
Padua, in Italy; and that of Leyden, whither many Englishmen
have resorted for study, notably Mr. Evelyn, whose book called
'Sylva' was in the Rector's library.</p>

<p>He carried on during the whole of this time a correspondence
with Mr. Boscorel on the paintings, statues, and architecture to be
seen wherever his travels carried him. These letters Mr. Boscorel
read aloud, with a map spread before him, discoursing on the
history of the place and the chief things to be seen there, before
he began to read. Surely there never was a man so much taken
up with the fine arts, especially as they were practised by the
ancients.</p>

<p>There remains the last of the boys&mdash;Robin, Sir Christopher's
grandson and heir. I should like this book to be all about Robin&mdash;yet
one must needs speak of the others. I declare, that from the
beginning, there never was a boy more happy, more jolly; never
anyone more willing to be always making someone happy. He
loved the open air, the wild creatures, the trees, the birds, everything
that lives beneath the sky; yet not&mdash;like my poor brother
Barnaby&mdash;a hater of books. He read all the books which told about
creatures, or hunting, or country life; and all voyages and travels.
A fresh-coloured, wholesome lad, not so grave as Humphrey, nor
so rustic as Barnaby, who always seemed to carry with him the
scent of woods and fields. He was to Sir Christopher, what
Benjamin was to Jacob. Even my father loved him though he was
so poor a scholar.</p>

<p>Those who stay at home have homely wits; that is well known:
therefore Robin must follow Humphrey to Oxford. He went
thither the year after his cousin. I never learned that he obtained<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
a scholarship, or that he was considered one of the younger pillars
of that learned and ancient University; or, indeed, that he took a
degree at all.</p>

<p>After he left Oxford he must go to London, there to study
Justice's Law and fit himself for the duties he would have to fulfil.
Also his grandfather would have him acquire some knowledge of
the Court and the City, and the ways of the great and the rich.
This, too, he did; though he never learned to prefer those ways to
the simple customs and habits of his Somerset village.</p>

<p>He, too, like the other two, bade me a tender farewell.</p>

<p>'Poor Alice!' he said, taking both my hands in his, 'what
wilt thou do when I am gone?'</p>

<p>Indeed, since Humphrey went away, we had been daily companions;
and at the thought of being thus left alone the tears were
running down my cheeks.</p>

<p>'Why, Sweetheart,' he said, 'to think that I should ever make
thee cry&mdash;I who desire nothing but to make thee always laugh and
be happy! What wilt thou do? Go often to my mother. She
loves thee as if thou wert her own daughter. Go and talk to her
concerning me. It pleaseth the poor soul to be still talking of her
son. And forget not my grandfather; play backgammon with him;
fill his pipe for him; sing to the spinnet for him; talk to him about
Humphrey and me. And forget not Mr. Boscorel, my uncle. The
poor man looks as melancholy since Humphrey went away as a
turtle robbed of her nest. I saw him yesterday opening one of his
drawers full of medals, and he sighed over them fit to break his
heart. He sighed for Humphrey, not for Ben. Well, child, what
more? Take Lance'&mdash;'twas his dog&mdash;'for a run every day; make
George Sparrow keep an eye upon the stream for otters; and&mdash;there
are a thousand things, but I will write them down. Have
patience with the dear old man when he will be still talking about
me.'</p>

<p>'Patience, Robin,' I said. 'Why, we all love to talk about
thee.'</p>

<p>'Do you all love to talk about me? Dost thou, too, Alice?
Oh, my dear, my dear!' Here he took me in his arms and kissed
me on the lips. 'Dost thou also love to talk about me? Why, my
dear, I shall think of nothing but of thee. Because&mdash;oh, my dear!&mdash;I
love thee with all my heart.'</p>

<p>Well, I was still so foolish that I understood nothing more than
that we all loved him, and he loved us all.</p>

<p>'Alice, I will write letters to thee. I will put them in the
packet for my mother. Thus thou wilt understand that I am
always thinking of thee.'</p>

<p>He was as good as his word. But the letters were so full of the
things he was doing and seeing, that it was quite clear that his
mind had plenty of room for more than one object. To be sure, I
should have been foolish, indeed, had I desired that his letters<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
should tell me that he was always thinking about me, when he
should have been attending to his business.</p>

<p>After a year in London, his grandfather thought that he should
travel. Therefore, he went abroad and joined Humphrey at Montpellier,
and with him rode northwards to Leyden, where he
sojourned while his cousin attended the lectures of that famous
school.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII.</h2>

<h3>A ROYAL PROGRESS.</h3>


<div class="drop">
<img src="images/i_059.jpg" alt="W" width="100" height="101" class="cap" />
 <p class="cap_1">When all the boys were gone the time was quiet, indeed,
for those who were left behind. My mother's
wheel went spinning still, but I think that some
kindness on the part of Mr. Boscorel as well as Sir
Christopher caused her weekly tale of yarn to be of
less importance. And as for me, not only would she never suffer
me to sit at the spinning-wheel, but there was so much request of
me (to replace the boys) that I was nearly all the day either with
Sir Christopher, or with Madam, or with Mr. Boscorel.</p>
</div>

<p>Up to the year 1680, or thereabouts, I paid no more attention
to political matters than any young woman with no knowledge may
be supposed to give. Yet, of course, I was on the side of liberty,
both civil and religious. How should that be otherwise, my father
being such as he was, muzzled for all these years, the work of his
life prevented and destroyed?</p>

<p>It was in that year, however, that I became a most zealous
partisan and lover of the Protestant cause in the way that I am
about to relate.</p>

<p>Everybody knows that there is no part of Great Britain (not even
Scotland) where the Protestant religion hath supporters more
stout and staunch than Somerset and Devonshire. I hope I shall
not be accused of disloyalty to Queen Anne, under whom we now
flourish and are happy, when I say that in the West of England
we had grown&mdash;I know not how&mdash;to regard the late misguided
Duke of Monmouth as the champion of the Protestant faith.
When, therefore, the Duke came into the West of England in the
year 1680, five years before his rebellion, he was everywhere
received with acclamations and by crowds who gathered round him
to witness their loyalty to the Protestant faith. They came also
to gaze upon the gallant commander who had defeated both the
French and the Dutch, and was said (but erroneously) to be as
wise as he was brave, and as religious as he was beautiful to look
upon. As for his wisdom, those who knew him best have since
assured the world that he had little or none, his judgment being
always swayed and determined for him by crafty and subtle persons
seeking their own interests. And as for his religion, whatever
may have been his profession, good works were wanting&mdash;as is now
very well known. But at that time, and among our people, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
wicked ways of Courts were only half understood. And there can
be no doubt that, whether he was wise or religious, the show of
affection with which the Duke was received upon this journey, turned
his head and caused him to think that these people would rally round
him if he called upon them. And I suppose that there is nothing
which more delights a Prince than to believe that his friends are
ready even to lay down their lives in his behalf.</p>

<p>At that time the country was greatly agitated by anxiety concerning
the succession. Those who were nearest the throne knew
that King Charles was secretly a Papist. We in the country had
not learned that dismal circumstance; yet we knew the religion of
the Duke of York. Thousands there were, like Sir Christopher
himself, who now lamented the return of the King, considering the
disgraces which had fallen upon the country. But what was done
could not be undone. They, therefore, asked themselves if the
nation would suffer an avowed Papist to ascend a Protestant
throne. If not, what should be done? And here, as everybody
knows, was opinion divided. For some declared that the Duke of
Monmouth, had he his rights, was the lawful heir; and others
maintained, on the King's own words, that he was never married to
Mistress Lucy Waters. Therefore, they would have the Duke of
York's daughter, a Protestant princess, married to William of
Orange, proclaimed Queen. The Monmouth party were strong,
however, and it was even said&mdash;Mr. Henry Clark, minister of
Crewkerne, wrote a pamphlet to prove it&mdash;that a poor woman,
Elizabeth Parcet by name, touched the Duke (he being ignorant of
the thing) for King's Evil, and was straightway healed. Sir
Christopher laughed at the story, saying that the King himself,
whether he was descended from a Scottish Stuart or from King
Solomon himself, could no more cure that dreadful disease than
the seventh son of a seventh son (as some foolish people believe),
or the rubbing of the part affected by the hand of a man that had
been hanged (as others do foolishly believe), which is the reason
why on the gibbets the hanging corpses are always handless.</p>

<p>It was noised abroad, beforehand, that the Duke was going to
ride through the West Country in order to visit his friends. The
progress (it was more like a Royal progress than the journey of a
private nobleman) began with his visit to Mr. Thomas Thynne, of
Longleat House. It is said that his chief reason for going to that
house was to connect himself with the obligation of the tenant of
Longleat to give the King and his suite a night's lodging when
they visited that part of the country. Mr. Thynne, who entertained
the Duke on this occasion, was the same who was afterwards
murdered in London by Count Konigsmark. They called him
'Tom of Ten Thousand.' The poet Dryden hath written of this
progress, in that poem wherein, under the fabled name of Absalom,
he figures the Duke:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">He now begins his progress to ordain,</span>
<span class="i0">With chariots, horsemen, and a numerous train.</span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Fame runs before him as the morning star,</span>
<span class="i0">And shouts of joy salute him from afar.</span>
<span class="i0">Each house receives him as a guardian god,</span>
<span class="i0">And consecrates the place of his abode.</span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p class="noind">It was for his hospitable treatment of the Duke that Mr. Thynne
was immediately afterwards deprived of the command of the Wiltshire
Militia.</p>

<p>'Son-in-law,' said Sir Christopher, 'I would ride out to meet
the Duke in respect to his Protestant professions. As for any
pretensions he may have to the succession, I know nothing of
them.'</p>

<p>'I will ride with you, Sir,' said the Rector, 'to meet the son of
the King. And as for any Protestant professions, I know nothing
of them. His Grace still remains, I believe, within the pale of
the Church as by law established. Let us all ride out together.'</p>

<p>Seeing that my father also rode with them, it is certain that
there were many and diverse reasons why so many thousands
gathered together to welcome the Duke. Madam, Robin's mother,
out of her kind heart, invited me to accompany her, and gave me
a white frock to wear and blue ribbons to put into it.</p>

<p>We made, with our servants, a large party. We were also
joined by many of the tenants, with their sons and wives, so that
when we came to Ilchester, Sir Christopher was riding at the head
of a great company of sixty or more, and very fine they looked, all
provided with blue favours in honour of the Duke.</p>

<p>From Bradford Orcas to Ilchester is but six miles as the crow
flies, but the ways (which are narrow and foul in winter) do so
wind and turn about that they add two miles at least to the distance.
Fortunately, the season was summer&mdash;namely, August&mdash;when
the sun is hottest and the earth is dry, so that no one was
bogged on the way.</p>

<p>We started betimes&mdash;namely, at six in the morning&mdash;because
we knew not for certain at what time the Duke would arrive at
Ilchester. When we came forth from the Manor House the farmers
were already waiting for us, and so, after greetings from his
Honour, they fell in and followed. We first took the narrow and
rough lane which leads to the high road; but, when we reached it,
we found it full of people riding, like ourselves, or trudging, staff
in hand, all in the same direction. They were going to gaze upon
the Protestant Duke, who, if he had his way, would restore freedom
of conscience, and abolish the Acts against the Nonconformists.
We rode through Marston Magna, but only the old people
and the little children were left there; in the fields the ripe corn
stood waiting to be cut; in the farmyards the beasts were standing
idle; all the hinds were gone to Ilchester to see the Duke. And I
began to fear lest when we got to Ilchester we should be too late.
At Marston we left the main road and entered upon a road (call it
a track rather than a road) across the country, which is here flat
and open. In winter it is miry and boggy, but it was now dry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
and hard. This path brought us again to the main road in two
miles, or thereabouts, and here we were but a mile or so from
Ilchester. Now, such a glorious sight as awaited us here I never
expected to see. Once again, after five years, I was to see a welcome
still more splendid; but nothing can ever efface from my
memory that day. For first, the roads, as I have said, were
thronged with rustics, and next, when we rode into the town we
found it filled with gentlemen most richly dressed, and ladies so
beautiful, and with such splendid attire that it dazzled my eyes to
look upon them. It was a grand thing to see the gentlemen
take off their hats and cry, 'Huzza for brave Sir Christopher!'
Everybody knew his opinions, and on what side he had fought in
the Civil War. The old man bent his head, and I think that he
was pleased with this mark of honour.</p>

<p>The town which, though ancient, is now decayed and hath but
few good houses in it, was made glorious with bright-coloured
cloths, carpets, flags, and ribbons. There were bands of music;
the bells of the church were ringing; the main street was like a
fair with booths and stalls, and in the market-place there were
benches set up with white canvas covering, where sat ladies in
their fine dresses, some of them with naked necks, unseemly to
behold. Yet it was pretty to see the long curls lying on their white
shoulders. Some of them sat with half-closed eyes, which, I have
since learned, is the fashion at Court. Mostly, they wore satin
petticoats, and demi-gowns also of satin, furnished with a long
train. Our place was beside the old Cross with its gilt ball and
vane. The people who filled the streets came from Sherborne,
from Bruton, from Shepton, from Glastonbury, from Langport, and
from Somerton, and from all the villages round. It was computed
that there were twenty thousand of them. Two thousand at least
rode out to meet the Duke, and followed after him when he rode
through the town. And, oh! the shouting as he drew near, the
clashing of the bells, the beating of the drums, the blowing of the
horns, the firing of the guns, as if the more noise they made the
greater would be the Duke.</p>

<p>Since that day I have not wondered at the power which a Prince
hath of drawing men after him, even to the death. Never was
heir to the Crown received with such joy and welcome as was this
young man, who had no title to the Crown and was base born.
Yet, because he was a brave young man, and comely above all other
young men, gracious of speech, and ready with a laugh and a joke,
and because he was the son of the King, and the reputed champion
of the Protestant faith, the people could not shout too loud for
him.</p>

<p>The Duke was at this time in the prime of manhood, being
thirty-five years of age. 'At that age,' Mr. Boscorel used to say,
'one would desire to remain if the body of clay were immortal.
For then the volatile humours of youth have been dissipated.
The time of follies has passed; love is regarded with the sober<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
eyes of experience; knowledge has been acquired; skill of eye
and hand has been gained, if one is so happy as to be a follower of
art and music; wisdom hath been reached, if wisdom is ever to be
attained. But wisdom,' he would add, 'is a quality generally
lacking at every period of life.'</p>

<p>'When last I saw the Duke,' he told us while we waited, 'was
fifteen years ago, in St. James's Park. He was walking with the
King, his father, who had his arm about his son's shoulders, and
regarded him fondly. At that time he was, indeed, a very David
for beauty. I suppose that he hath not kept that singular loveliness
which made him the darling of the Court. That, indeed, were
not a thing to be desired or expected. He is now the hero of
Maestricht, and the Chancellor of Cambridge University.'</p>

<p>And then all hats were pulled off, and the ladies waved their
handkerchiefs, and the men shouted, and you would have thought
the bells would have pulled the old tower down with the vehemence
of their ringing; for the Duke was riding into the town.</p>

<p>He was no longer a beautiful boy, but a man at whose aspect
every heart was softened. His enemies, in his presence, could not
blame him; his friends, at sight of him, could not praise him,
of such singular beauty was he possessed. Softness, gentleness,
kindness, and goodwill reigned in his large soft eyes: graciousness
sat upon his lips, and all his face seemed to smile as he rode slowly
between the lane formed by the crowd on either hand.</p>

<p>What said the Poet Dryden in that same poem of his from which
I have already quoted?&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Early in foreign fields he won renown</span>
<span class="i0">With Kings and States allied to Israel's crown;</span>
<span class="i0">In peace the thoughts of war he could remove,</span>
<span class="i0">And seemed as he were only born for love.</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Whate'er he did was done with so much ease,</span>
<span class="i0">In him alone 'twas natural to please;</span>
<span class="i0">His motions all accompanied with grace,</span>
<span class="i0">And Paradise was opened in his face.</span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>Now I have to tell of what happened to me&mdash;the most insignificant
person in the whole crowd. It chanced that as the Duke came near
the spot beside the Cross where we were standing, the press in front
obliged him to stop. He looked about him while he waited,
smiling still and bowing to the people. Presently his eyes fell
upon me, and he whispered a gentleman who rode beside him, yet
a little in the rear. This gentleman laughed and dismounted.
What was my confusion when he advanced towards me and spoke
to me!</p>

<p>'Madam,' he said, calling me 'Madam!' 'His Grace would say
one word to you, with permission of your friends.'</p>

<p>'Go with this gentleman, child,' said Sir Christopher, laughing.
Everybody laughs&mdash;I know not why&mdash;when a girl is led out to be
kissed.</p>

<p>'Fair White Rose of Somerset,' said his Grace&mdash;twas the most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
musical voice in the world, and the softest. 'Fair White Rose'&mdash;he
repeated the words&mdash;'let me be assured of the welcome of
Ilchester by a kiss from your sweet lips, which I will return in
token of my gratitude.'</p>

<p>All the people who heard these words shouted as if they would
burst themselves asunder. And the gentleman who had led me
forth lifted me so that my foot rested on the Duke's boot, while his
Grace laid his arm tenderly round my waist, and kissed me twice.</p>

<p>'Sweet child,' he said, 'what is thy name?'</p>

<p>'By your Grace's leave,' I said, the words being very strange, 'my
name is Alice. I am the daughter of Dr. Comfort Eykin, an ejected
minister. I have come with Sir Christopher Challis, who stands
yonder.'</p>

<p>'Sir Christopher!' said the Duke, as if surprised. 'Let me
shake hands with Sir Christopher. I take it kindly, Sir Christopher,
that you have so far honoured me.' So he gave the old man, who
stepped forward bareheaded, his hand, still holding me by the
waist. 'I pray that we may meet again, Sir Christopher, and that
before long.' Then he drew a gold ring, set with an emerald, from
his forefinger, and placed it upon mine, 'God grant it bring thee
luck, sweet child,' he said, and kissed me again, and then suffered me
to be lifted down. And you may be sure that it was with red
cheeks that I took my place among my friends. Yet Sir Christopher
was pleased at the notice taken of him by the Duke, and my father
was not displeased at the part I had been made to play.</p>

<p>When the Duke had ridden through the town, many of the
people followed after, as far as White Lackington, which is close to
Ilminster. So many were they that they took down a great piece
of the park paling to admit them all; and there, under a Spanish
chestnut-tree, the Duke drank to the health of all the people.</p>

<p>At Ilminster, whither he rode a few days later; at Chard, a
Ford Abbey, at Colyton, and at Exeter&mdash;wherever he went he was
received with the same shouts and acclamations. It is no wonder
therefore, that he should believe, a few years later, that those people
would follow him when he drew the sword for the Protestant
religion.</p>

<p>One thing is certain&mdash;that in the West of England, from the
progress of Monmouth to the Rebellion, there was uneasiness, with
an anxious looking forward to troubled times. The people of
Taunton kept as a day of holiday and thanksgiving the anniversary
of the raising of Charles's siege. When the Mayor, in 1683, tried to
stop the celebration, they nearly stoned him to death. After this,
Sir George Jeffreys, afterwards Lord Jeffreys, who took the spring
circuit in 1684, was called upon to report on the loyalty of the West
Country. He reported that the gentry were loyal and well disposed.
But he knew not the mind of the weavers and spinners of the
country.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 457px;">
<img src="images/i_065.jpg" width="457" height="600" alt="Rose" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">'<i>Fair White Rose of Somerset, let me be assured by a kiss from your
sweet lips.</i>'</p></div>
</div>

<p>It was this progress; the sight of the Duke's sweet face; his
flattery of me, and his soft words, and the ring he gave me, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
made me from that moment such a partisan of his cause as only a
woman can be. Women cannot fight, but they can encourage those
who do; and they can not only ardently desire, but they can despise
and contemn those who think otherwise. I cannot say that it was
I who persuaded our boys five years later to join the Duke; but I
can truly say that I did and said all that a woman can; that I
rejoiced when they did so; and that I should never have forgiven
Robin had he joined the forces of the Papist King.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER IX.</h2>

<h3>WITH THE ELDERS.</h3>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 222px;">
<img src="images/i_068.jpg" width="222" height="300" alt="So" />
</div>

<p>So we went home again, all
well pleased, and I holding the
Duke's ring tight,
I promise you. It was
a most beautiful ring
when I came to look at
it; a great emerald was
in the midst of it, with
little pearls and emeralds
set alternately around it.
Never was such a grand
gift to so humble a person.
I tied it to a black ribbon,
and put it in the box which
held my clothes. But sometimes
I could not forbear
the pleasure of wearing it
round my neck secretly; not for the
joy of possessing the ring, so much
as for remembering the lovely face
and the gracious words of the giver.</p>

<p>At that time I was in my sixteenth year, but
well-grown for my age. Like my father, I was
above the common stature and taller than most.
We continued for more than four years longer to
live without the company of the boys, which caused me to
be much in the society of my elders, and as much at the Manor House
and the Rectory as at home. At the former place, Sir Christopher
loved to have me with him all day long, if my mother would suffer
it; when he walked abroad, I must walk with him; when he walked
in his garden I must be at his side. When he awoke after his
afternoon sleep, he liked to see me sitting ready to talk to him. I
must play to him and sing to him; or I must bring out the backgammon
board; or I must read the last letters from Robin and
Humphrey. Life is dull for an old man whose friends are mostly
dead, unless he have the company of the young. So David, in his
old age, took to himself a young wife. I have sometimes thought
that he would have done better to have comforted his heart with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
the play and prattle of his grandchildren&mdash;of whom, I suppose, there
must have been many families.</p>

<p>Now, as I was so much with his Honour, I had much talk with
him upon things on which wise and ancient men do not often converse
with girls, and I was often present when he discoursed with
my father or with his son-in-law, the Rector, on high and serious
matters. It was a time of great anxiety and uncertainty. There
were great Pope burnings in the country; and when some were put
in pillory for riot at these bonfires not a hand was lifted against
them. They had one at Sherborne on November 17, the anniversary
of Queen Elizabeth's Coronation day, instead of November 5,
Guy Faux Day. Boys went about the streets asking for halfpence
and singing&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Up with the ladder,</span>
<span class="i2">And down with the rope;</span>
<span class="i0">Give us a penny</span>
<span class="i2">To burn the old Pope.</span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p class="noind">There were riots in Taunton, where the High Church party burned
the pulpit of a meeting-house; people went about openly saying that
the Roundheads would soon come back again. From Robin we heard
of the Popish plot, and the flight of the Duke of York, and afterwards
of Monmouth's disgrace and exile. At all the market towns
where men gathered together they talked of these things, and
many whispered together: a thing which Sir Christopher loved not,
because it spoke of conspiracies and secret plots, whereas he was
all for bold declaration of conscience.</p>

<p>In short, it was an anxious time, and everybody understood that
serious things would happen should the King die. There were not
wanting, besides, omens of coming ills&mdash;if you accept such things
as omens or warnings. To Taunton (afterwards the town most
affected by the Rebellion) a plain warning was vouchsafed by the
rumbling and thundering and shaking of the earth itself, so that
dishes were knocked down and cups broken, and plaster shaken off
the walls of houses. And once (this did I myself see with my own
eyes) the sun rose with four other suns for companions&mdash;a most
terrifying sight, though Mr. Boscorel, who spoke learnedly on
omens, had an explanation of this miracle, which he said was due
to natural causes alone. And at Ile Brewers there was a monstrous
birth of two girls with but one body from the breast downwards;
their names were Aquila and Priscilla; but I believe they lived
but a short time.</p>

<p>I needs must tell of Mr. Boscorel, because he was a man the
like of whom I have never since beheld. I believe there can be
few men such as he was, who could so readily exchange the world
of heat and argument for the calm and dispassionate air of art and
music. Even religion (if I may venture to say so) seemed of less
importance to him than painting and sculpture. I have said that
he taught me to play upon the spinnet. Now that Humphrey was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
gone, he desired my company every day, in order, he pretended,
that I might grow perfect in my performance, but in reality because
he was lonely at the Rectory, and found pleasure in my company.
We played together&mdash;he upon the violoncello and I upon the spinnet&mdash;such
music as he chose. It was sometimes grave and solemn
music, such as Lulli's 'Miserere' or his 'De Profundis'; sometimes
it was some part of a Roman Catholic Mass: then was my soul uplifted
and wafted heavenwards by the chords, which seemed prayer
and praise fit for the angels to harp before the throne. Sometimes it
was music which spoke of human passions, when I would be, in like
manner, carried out of myself. My master would watch not only
my execution, commenting or correcting, but he would also watch
the effect of the music upon my mind.</p>

<p>'We are ourselves,' he said, 'like unto the instruments upon
which we play. For as one kind of instrument, as the drum, produces
but one note; and another, as the cymbals, but a clashing
which is in itself discordant, but made effective in a band; so
others are, like the most delicate and sensitive violins&mdash;those of
Cremona&mdash;capable of producing the finest music that the soul of
man hath ever devised. It is by such music, child, that some of
us mount unto heaven. As for me, indeed, I daily feel more and
more that music leadeth the soul upward, and that, as regards the
disputations on the Word of God, the letter indeed killeth, but the
spirit which music helpeth us to feel&mdash;the spirit, I say, giveth life.'
He sighed, and drew his bow gently across the first string of his
violoncello. ''Tis a time of angry argument. The Word of God
is thrown from one to the other as a pebble is shot from a sling. It
wearies me. In this room, among these books of music, my soul
finds rest, and the spiritual part of me is lifted heavenwards.
Humphrey and you, my dear, alone can comprehend this saying.
Thou hast a mind like his, to feel and understand what music
means. Listen!' Here he executed a piece of music at which the
tears rose to my eyes. 'That is from the Romish Mass which we
are taught ignorantly to despise. My child, I am, indeed, no
Catholic, and I hold that ours is the purer Church; yet, in losing
the Mass, we have lost the great music with which the Catholics
sustain their souls. Some of our anthems, truly, are good; but
what is a single anthem, finished in ten minutes, compared with a
grand Mass which lasts three hours?'</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 441px;">
<img src="images/i_071.jpg" width="441" height="600" alt="playing" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">'<i>We played together, he on the violoncello, I upon the spinnet.</i>'</p></div>
</div>

<p>Then he had portfolios filled with engravings, which he would
bring forth and contemplate with a kind of rapture, discoursing
upon the engraver's art and its difficulties, so that I should not, as
is the case with ignorant persons, suppose that these things were
produced without much training and skill. He had also boxes full
of coins, medals, and transparent gems carved most delicately with
heathen gods and goddesses, shepherds and swains, after the
ancient fashion, unclothed and unashamed. On these things he
would gaze with admiration which he tried to teach me, but could
not succeed, because I cannot believe that we may without blame<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
look upon such figures. Nevertheless, they were most beautiful,
the hands and faces and the very hair so delicately and exquisitely
carved that you could hardly believe it possible. And he talked
solemnly and scholarly of these gauds, as if they were things
which peculiarly deserved the attention of wise and learned men.
Nay, he would be even lifted out of himself in considering them.</p>

<p>'Child,' he said, 'we know not, and we cannot even guess, the
wonders of art that in heaven we shall learn to accomplish'&mdash;as if
carving and painting were the occupation of angels!&mdash;'or the
miracles of beauty and of dexterity that we shall be able to design
and execute. Here, the hand is clumsy and the brain is dull; we
cannot rise above ourselves; we are blind to the beauty with
which the Lord hath filled the earth for the solace of human creatures.
Nay; we are not even tender with the beauty that we see
and love. We suffer maidens sweet as the dreams of poets to
waste their beauty unpraised and unsung. I am old, child, or I
would praise thee in immortal verse. Much I fear that thou wilt
grow old without the praise of sweet numbers. Well; there is no
doubt more lasting beauty of face and figure hereafter to joy the
souls of the elect. And thou wilt make his happiness for one
man on earth. Pray Heaven, sweet child, that he look also to
thine!'</p>

<p>He would say such things with so grand an air, speaking as if his
words should command respect, and with so kindly an eye and a
soft smile, while he gently stroked the side of his nose, which was
long, that I was always carried away with the authority of it, and
not till after I left him did I begin to perceive that my father
would certainly never allow that the elect should occupy themselves
with the frivolous pursuits of painting and the fine arts, but
only with the playing of their harps and the singing of praises.
It was this consideration which caused him to consent that his
daughter should learn the spinnet. I did not tell him (God forgive
me for the deceit, if there was any!) that we sometimes played
music written for the Mass; nor did I repeat what Mr. Boscorel
said concerning art and the flinging about of the Word of God,
because my father was wholly occupied in controversy, and his
principal, if not his only, weapon was the Word of God.</p>

<p>Another pleasure which we had was to follow Humphrey in his
travels by the aid of his letters and a 'Mappa Mundi,' or atlas,
which the Rector possessed. Then I remember when we heard
that the boys were about to ride together through France, from
Montpellier to Leyden in Holland, we had on the table the great
map of France. There were many drawings, coats-of-arms, and
other pretty things on the map.</p>

<p>'It is now,' said Mr. Boscorel, finding out the place he wanted,
and keeping his forefinger upon it, 'nearly thirty years since I
made the grand tour, being then governor to the young Lord Silchester,
who afterwards died of the Plague in London. Else had
I been now a Bishop, who am forgotten in this little place. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
boys will ride, I take it, by the same road which we took: first, because
it is the high road and the safest; next, because it is the
best provided with inns and resting places; and, lastly, because it
passes through the best part of his Most Christian Majesty's
dominions, and carries the traveller through his finest and most
stately cities. From Montpellier they will ride&mdash;follow my finger,
child!&mdash;to Nismes. Before the Revocation it was a great place
for those of the Reformed Religion, and a populous town. Here
they will not fail to visit the Roman temple which still stands. It
is not, indeed, such a noble monument as one may see in Rome;
but it is in good preservation, and a fair example of the later style.
They will also visit the great amphitheatre, which should be cleared
of the mean houses which are now built up within it, and so exposed
in all its vastness to the admiration of the world. After
seeing these things they will direct their way across a desolate
piece of country to Avignon, passing on the way the ancient Roman
aqueduct called the Pont de Gard. At Avignon they will admire
the many churches and the walls, and will not fail to visit the
palace of the Popes during the Great Schism. Thence they will
ride northwards, unless they wish first to see the Roman remains
at Arles. Thence will they proceed up the Valley of the Rhone,
through many stately towns, till they come to Lyons, where,
doubtless, they will sojourn for a few days. Next, they will
journey through the rich country of Burgundy, and from the
ancient town of Dijon will reach Paris through the city of Fontainebleau.
On the way they will see many noble houses and
castles, with rich towns and splendid churches. In no country
are there more splendid churches, built in the Gothic style, which
we have now forgotten. Some of them, alas! have been defaced
in the wars (so-called of Religion), where, as happened also to us,
the delicate carved work, the scrolls and flowers and statues were
destroyed, and the painted windows broken. Alas! that men
should refuse to suffer Art to become the minister and handmaid
of Religion! Yet in the first and most glorious temple, in which
the glory of the Lord was visibly present, there were carved and
graven lilies, with lions, oxen, chariots, cherubim, palm-trees and
pomegranates.'</p>

<p>He closed his atlas and sat down.</p>

<p>'Child,' he said, meditating, 'for a scholar, in his youth,
there is no pleasure comparable with the pleasure of travelling in
strange countries, among the monuments of ancient days. My
own son did never, to my sorrow, desire the pleasant paths of
learning, and did never show any love for the arts, in which I have
always taken so great delight. He desireth rather the companionship
of men; he loveth to drink and sing; and he nourisheth a
huge ambition. 'Tis best that we are not all alike. Humphrey
should have been my son. Forget not, my child, that he hath
desired to be remembered to thee in every letter which he hath
written.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span></p>

<p>If the Rector spoke much of Humphrey, Madam made amends
by talking continually of Robin, and of the great things that he
would do when he returned home. Justice of the Peace, that he
would certainly be made; Captain first and afterwards Colonel in
the Somerset Militia, that also should he be; Knight of the
Shire, if he were ambitious&mdash;but that I knew he would never be;
High Sheriff of the County, if his slender means permitted&mdash;for
the estate was not worth more than five or six hundred pounds a
year. Perhaps he would marry an heiress: it would be greatly to
the advantage of the family if an heiress were to come into it with
broad acres of her own; but she was not a woman who would seek
to control her son in the matter of his affections, and if he chose a
girl with no fortune to her back, if she was a good girl and pious,
Madam would never say him nay. And he would soon return.
The boy had been at Oxford and next in London, learning law,
such as Justices require. He was now with Humphrey at the
University of Leyden, doubtless learning more law.</p>

<p>'My dear,' said Madam, 'we want him home. His grandfather
groweth old, though still, thank God! in the full possession of his
faculties. Yet a young man's presence is needed. I trust and
pray that he will return as he went, innocent, in spite of the many
temptations of the wicked city. And, oh! child&mdash;what if he
should have lost his heart to some designing city hussy!'</p>

<p>He came&mdash;as you shall hear immediately&mdash;Robin came home.
Would to God that he had waited, if only for a single month! Had
he not come all our afflictions would have been spared us! Had he
not come that good old man, Sir Christopher&mdash;&mdash;but it is vain to
imagine what might have been. We are in the hands of the Lord;
nothing that happens to us is permitted but by Him, and for some
wise purpose was Sir Christopher in his old age&mdash;alas! why should
I anticipate what I have to narrate?</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X.</h2>

<h3>LE ROY EST MORT.</h3>


<div class="drop">
<img src="images/i_076.jpg" alt="I" width="100" height="99" class="cap" />
 <p class="cap_1">I n February of the year 1685, King Charles II. died.</p>

<p>Sir Christopher himself brought us the news from
Sherborne, whither he had gone, as was his wont, to
the weekly ordinary. He clattered up the lane on his
cob, and halted at our gate.</p>
</div>

<p>'Call thy father, child. Give you good day, Madam Eykin.
Will your husband leave his books and come forth for a moment?
Tell him I have news.'</p>

<p>My father rose and obeyed. His gown was in rags; his feet
were clad in cloth shoon, which I worked for him; his cheek was
wasted; but his eye was keen. He was lean and tall; his hair was
as white as Sir Christopher's, though he was full twenty years
younger.</p>

<p>'Friend and gossip,' said Sir Christopher, 'the King is dead.'</p>

<p>'Is Charles Stuart dead?' my father replied. 'He cumbered
the earth too long. For five-and-twenty years hath he persecuted
the saints. Also he hath burnt incense after the abomination of
the heathen. Let his lot be as the lot of Ahaz.'</p>

<p>'Nay; he is buried by this time. His brother the Duke of
York hath been proclaimed King.'</p>

<p>'James the Papist. It is as though Manasseh should succeed
to Ahaz. And after him Jehoiakim.'</p>

<p>'Yet the bells will ring and we shall pray for the King; and
wise men, friend Eykin, will do well to keep silence.'</p>

<p>'There is a time to speak and a time to keep silence. It may
be that the time is at hand when a godly man must stretch forth
his hand to tear down the Scarlet Woman, though she slay him in
the attempt.'</p>

<p>'It may be so, my friend; yet stretch not forth thine hand until
thou art well assured of the Divine Command. The King is dead.
Now will my son-in-law ring out the bells for the new King, and
we shall pray for him, as we prayed for his brother. It is our
duty to pray for all in authority, though to the prayers of a whole
nation there seemeth, so far as human reason can perceive, no
answer.'</p>

<p>'I for one will pray no more for a King who is a Papist.
Rather will I pray daily for his overthrow.'</p>

<p>'King Charles is said to have received a priest before he died.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
Yet it is worse that the King should be an open than a secret
Catholic. Let us be patient, my friend, and await the time.'</p>

<p>So he rode up the village, and presently the bells were set
a-ringing, and they clashed as joyously, echoing around the Corton
Hills, as if the accession of King James II. was the only thing
wanted to make the nation prosperous, happy, and religious.</p>

<p>My father stood at the gate after Sir Christopher left him.
The wind was cold, and the twilight was falling, and his cassock
was thin, but he remained there motionless, until my mother went
out and drew him back to the house by the arm. He went into
his own room, but he read no more that day.</p>

<p>In the evening he came forth and sat with us, and while I sat
sewing, my mother spinning by the light of the fire, he discoursed,
which was unusual with him, upon things and peoples and the
best form of government, which he held to be a Commonwealth,
with a strong man for President. But he was to hold his power
from the people, and was to lay it down frequently, lest he should
in his turn be tempted to become a King. And if he were to fall
away from righteousness, or to live in open sin, or to be a merry-maker,
or to suffer his country to fall from a high place among the
nations, he was to be displaced, and be forced to retire. As for
the man Charles, now dead, he would become, my father said, an
example to all future ages, and a warning of what may happen
when the doctrine of Divine Right is generally accepted and acted
upon; the King himself being not so much blamed by him as the
practice of hereditary rule which caused him to be seated upon
the throne, when his true place, my father said, was among the
lacqueys and varlets of the palace. 'His brother James,' he
added, 'hath now an opportunity such as is given to few&mdash;for he
may become another Josiah. But I think he will neglect that
opportunity,' he concluded; 'yea, even if Hilkiah, the priest,
were to bring him a message from Huldah, the prophetess; for he
doth belong to a family which, by the Divine displeasure, can
never perceive the truth. Let us now read the Word, and wrestle
with the Lord in prayer.'</p>

<p>Next we heard that loyal addresses were poured in from all
quarters congratulating the King, and promising most submissive
obedience. One would have thought that the people were rejoiced
at the succession of a Roman Catholic; it was said that the King
had promised liberty of conscience unto all; that he claimed that
liberty for himself, and that he went to Mass daily and openly.</p>

<p>But many there were who foresaw trouble. Unfortunately, one
of them was Sir Christopher, who spoke his mind at all times too
fiercely for his safety. Mr. Boscorel, also, was of opinion that
civil war would speedily ensue.</p>

<p>'The King's friends,' he said, 'may for a time buy the support
of the Nonconformists, and make a show of religious liberty.
Thus may they govern for a while. But it is not in the nature of
the Roman Catholic priest to countenance religious liberty, or ever<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
to sit down contented with less than all the pie. They must for
ever scheme and intrigue for more power. Religious liberty? It
means to them the eternal damnation of those who hold themselves
free to think for themselves. They would be less than human
if they did not try to save the souls of the people by docking their
freedom. They must make this country even as Spain or Italy.
Is it to be believed that they will suffer the Church to retain her
revenues, or the universities to remain out of their control? Nay,
will they allow the grammar schools to be in the hands of Protestants?
Never! The next generation will be wholly Catholic,
unless the present generation send King and priests packing.'</p>

<p>These were treasonable words, but they were uttered in the
hall of the Manor House with no other persons present than Sir
Christopher and the Rector himself.</p>

<p>'Seeing these things, son-in-law,' said Sir Christopher, 'what
becomes of Right Divine? Where is the duty of Non-Resistance?'</p>

<p>'The doctrine of Right Divine,' said Mr. Boscorel, rubbing
his nose, 'includes the Divine institution of a Monarchy, which,
I confess, is manifestly untenable, because the Lord granted a King
to the people only because they clamoured for one. Also, had the
institution been of Divine foundation, the Jews would never have
been allowed to live under the rule of Judges, Tetrarchs, and Roman
Governors.'</p>

<p>'You have not always spoken so plainly,' said Sir Christopher.</p>

<p>'Nay; why be always proclaiming to the world your thoughts
and opinions? Besides, even if the doctrine of Non-Resistance
were sound, there may be cases in which just laws may be
justly set aside. I say not that this is one, as yet. But if there
were danger of the ancient superstitions being thrust upon us to
the destruction of our souls, I say not that we should meekly sit
down. Nay; if a starving man take a loaf of bread, there being
no other way possible to save his life, one would not, therefore,
hold him a thief. Yet the law remains.'</p>

<p>'Shall the blood which hath been poured out for the cause of
liberty prove to be shed in vain?' asked Sir Christopher.</p>

<p>'Why, Sir,' said the Rector, 'the same question might be
asked in France, where the Protestants fought longer and against
greater odds than we in this country. Yet the blood of those
martyrs hath been shed, so far as man can see, in vain; the Church
of Rome is there the conqueror indeed. It is laid upon the Protestants,
even upon us, who hold that we are a true branch of the
ancient Apostolic Church, to defend ourselves continually against an
enemy who is always at unity, always guided by one man, always
knows what he wants, and is always working to get it. We, on
the other hand, do not know our own minds, and must for ever be
quarrelling among ourselves. Nevertheless, the heart of the
country is Protestant; and sooner or later the case of conscience
may arise whether&mdash;the law remaining unchanged&mdash;we may not
blamelessly break the law.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span></p>

<p>That case of conscience was not yet ripe for consideration. There
needed first many things&mdash;including the martyrdom of saints and
innocent men and poor, ignorant rustics&mdash;before the country
roused herself once more to seize her liberties. Then as to that
poor doctrine of Divine Right, they all made a mouthful of it,
except only a small and harmless band of Nonjurors.</p>

<p>At the outset, whatever the opinions of the people&mdash;who could
have been made to rise as one man&mdash;the gentry remained loyal.
Above all things, they dreaded another civil war.</p>

<p>'We must fain accept the King's professions,' said the Rector.
'If we have misgivings, let us disguise them. Let us rather nourish
the hope that they are honestly meant; and let us wait. England
will not become another Spain in a single day. Let us wait. The
stake is not yet set up in Smithfield, and the Inquisition is not yet
established in the country.'</p>

<p>It was in this temper that the King's accession found Sir
Christopher. Afterwards, he was accused of having harboured
designs against the King from the beginning. That, indeed, was
not the case. He had no thought of entering into any such enterprise.
Yet he never doubted that in the end there would be an
uprising against the rule of the priests. Nor did he doubt that the
King would be pushed on by his advisers to one pretension after
another for the advancement of his own prerogative and the displacement
of the Protestant Church. Nay, he openly predicted
that there would be such attempts; and he maintained&mdash;such was
his wisdom!&mdash;that, in the long run, the Protestant faith would be
established upon a surer foundation than ever. But as for conspiring
or being cognisant of any conspiracy, that was untrue. Why, he
was at this time seventy-five years of age&mdash;a time when such men
as Sir Christopher have continually before their eyes Death and
the Judgment.</p>

<p>As for my father, perhaps I am wrong, but in the daily prayers
of night and morning, and in the grace before meat, he seemed to
find a freer utterance, and to wrestle more vehemently than was
his wont on the subject of the Scarlet Woman, offering himself as a
willing martyr and confessor, if by the shedding of his blood the
great day of her final overthrow might be advanced; yet always
humble, not daring to think of himself as anything but an instrument
to do the will of his Master. In the end, his death truly
helped, with others, to bring a Protestant King to the Throne of
these isles. And since we knew him to be so deep a scholar, always
reading and learning, and in no sense a man of activity, the thing
which he presently did amazed us all. Yet we ought to have known
that one who is under the Divine command to preach the Word of
God, and hath been silenced by man for more than twenty years,
so that the strength of his manhood hath run to waste and is lost&mdash;it
is a most terrible and grievous thing for a man to be condemned
to idleness!&mdash;may become like unto one of those burning mountains
of which we sometimes read in books of voyages. In him, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
in them, the inner fires rage and burn, growing ever stronger and
fiercer, until presently they rend asunder the sides of the mountain
and burst forth, pouring down liquid fire over the unhappy valleys
beneath, with showers of red-hot ashes to destroy and cover up the
smiling homesteads and the fertile meadows.</p>

<p>It is true that my father chafed continually at the inaction forced
upon him, but his impatience was never so strong as at this time,
namely, after the accession of King James. It drove him from his
books and out into the fields and lanes, where he walked to and fro
waving his long arms, and sometimes crying aloud and shouting in
the woods, as if compelled to cry out in order to quench some raging
fever or heat of his mind.</p>

<p>About this time, too, I remember, they began to talk of the
exiles in Holland. The Duke of Monmouth was there with the
Earl of Argyle, and with them a company of firebrands eager to
get back to England and their property.</p>

<p>I am certain now that my father (and perhaps through his
information, Sir Christopher also) was kept acquainted with the
plots and designs that were carried on in the Low Countries. Nay,
I am also certain that his informant was none other than Humphrey,
who was still in Leyden. I have seen a letter from him, written,
as I now understand, in a kind of allegory or parable, in which one
thing was said and another meant. Thus, he pretends to speak of
Dutch gardening:&mdash;'The gardeners,' he says, 'take infinite pains
that their secrets shall not be learned or disclosed. I know, however,
that a certain blue tulip much desired by many gardeners in
England, will be taken across the water this year, and I hope that
by next year the precious bulb may be fully planted in English soil.
The preparation of the soil necessary for the favourable reception
of the bulb is well known to you, and you will understand how to
mix your soil and to add manure and so forth. I myself expect to
finish what I have to do in a few weeks, when I shall cross to London,
and so ride westwards, and hope to pay my respects to my revered
tutor in the month of June next. It may be that I shall come with
the tulip, but that is not certain. Many messages have been received
offering large sums of money for the bulb, so that it is hoped that
the Dutch gardeners will let it go.</p>

<p class="sig">
'From H. C.'
</p>

<p>The tulip, in a word, was the Duke of Monmouth, and the
Dutch gardeners were the Scotch and English exiles then in
Holland, and the English gardeners were the Duke's friends, and
H. C. was Humphrey Challis.</p>

<p>I think that Sir Christopher must have known of this correspondence,
because I now remember that my father would sit with
him for many hours looking at a map of England, conversing long
and earnestly, and making notes in a book. These notes he made
in the Arabic character, which no one but himself could read. I
therefore suppose that he was estimating the number of Nonconformists<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
who might be disposed to aid in such an enterprise as
Humphrey's 'gardeners' were contemplating.</p>

<p>Robin, who certainly was no conspirator, also wrote a letter
from Leyden about this time saying that something was expected,
nobody knew what; but that the exiles were meeting constantly,
as if something was brewing.</p>

<p>It was about the first week of June that the news came to us of
Lord Argyle's landing. This was the beginning. After that, as
you will hear, the news came thick and fast; every day something
fresh, and something to quicken the most sluggish pulse. To me,
at least, it seemed as if the breath of God Himself was poured out
upon the country, and that the people were everywhere resolved to
banish the accursed thing from their midst. Alas! I was but a
simple country maid and I was deceived! The accursed thing was
to be driven forth, but not yet. The country party hated the
Pope, but they dreaded civil war; and, indeed, there is hardly any
excuse for that most dreadful scourge except the salvation of the
soul and the safeguarding of liberties. They would gladly welcome
a rising, but it must be general and universal. They had for five-and-twenty
years been taught the wickedness of rebellion, and now
there was no way to secure the Protestant Faith except by rebellion.
Unhappily, the rebellion began before the country gentlemen
were ready to begin.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI.</h2>

<h3>BEFORE THE STORM.</h3>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 209px;">
<img src="images/i_082.jpg" width="209" height="300" alt="Before" />
</div>

<p>Before the storm breaks
there sometimes falls upon
the earth a brief time when
the sun shines in splendour
from a clear sky, the air
is balmy and delightsome,
the birds sing in the coppice,
and the innocent
lambs leap in the meadows.
Then, suddenly,
dark clouds gather from
the north; the wind blows
cold; in a minute the sky
is black; the lightnings
flash, the thunders roll, the
wind roars, the hail beats down and strips
the orchard of its promise, and silences
the birds cowering in the branches, and
drives the trembling sheep to take shelter in the
hedges. This was to be my case. You shall
understand how for a single day&mdash;it was no more&mdash;I
was the happiest girl in all the world.</p>

<p>I may now without any shame confess that I have
always loved Robin from my earliest childhood. That
was no great wonder seeing what manner of boy he
was, and how he was always kind and thoughtful for
me. We were at first only brother and sister together, which is
natural and reasonable when children grow up together; nor can
I tell when or how we ceased to be brother and sister, save that
it may have been when Robin kissed me so tenderly at parting,
and told me that he should always love me. I do not think that
brothers do generally protest love and promise continual affection.
Barnaby certainly never declared his love for me, nor did he ever
promise to love me all his life. Perhaps, had he remained longer,
he might have become as tender as he was good-hearted; but I
think that tenderness towards a sister is not in the nature of a
boy. I loved Robin, and I loved Humphrey, both as if they were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
brothers; but one of them ceased to be my brother, while the other,
in consequence, remained my brother always.</p>

<p>A girl may be ignorant of the world as I was, and of lovers and
their ways as I was, and yet she cannot grow from a child to a
woman without knowing that when a young man, who hath
promised to love her always, speaks of her in every letter, he
means more than common brotherly love. Nor can any woman be
indifferent to a man who thus regards her; nor can she think upon
love without the desire of being herself loved. Truly, I had
always before my eyes the spectacle of that holy love which consecrates
every part of life. I mean, in the case of my mother,
whose waking and sleeping thoughts were all for her husband, who
worked continually and cheerfully with her hands that he might be
enabled to study without other work, and gave up her whole life,
without grudging&mdash;even reckoning it her happiness and her privilege&mdash;in
order to provide food and shelter for him. It was enough
reward for her that he should sometimes lay his hand lovingly upon
her head, or turn his eyes with affection to meet hers.</p>

<p>It was in the night of June 12, as I lay in bed, not yet asleep,
though it was already past nine o'clock, that I heard the trampling
of hoofs crossing the stream and passing our cottage. Had I
known who were riding those horses there would have been but
little sleep for me that night. But I knew not, and did not suspect,
and so, supposing that it was only one of the farmers belated,
I closed my eyes, and presently slept until the morning.</p>

<p>About five o clock, or a little before that time, I awoke, the sun
having already arisen, and being now well up above the hills. I
therefore arose softly, leaving my mother asleep still, and, having
dressed quickly, and prayed a little, I crept down the stairs. In
the house there was such a stillness that I could even hear the
regular breathing of my father as he slept upon his pallet among
his books; it was chill and damp (as is the custom in the early
morning) in the room where he lived and worked. Yet, when I
threw open door and shutter and looked outside, the air was full of
warmth and refreshment; as for the birds, they had long since left
their nests, and now were busy looking for their breakfast; the
larks were singing overhead, and the bees already humming and
droning. Who would lie abed when he could get up and enjoy the
beauty of the morning? When I had breathed a while, with pleasure
and satisfaction, the soft air, which was laden with the scent of flowers
and of hay, I went indoors again and swept and dusted the room.
Then I opened the cupboard, and considered the provision for
breakfast. For my father there would be a slice of cold bacon with
a good crust of home-made bread (better bread or sweeter was nowhere
to be had) and a cup of cider, warming to the spirits and
good, for one who is no longer young, against any rawness of the
morning air. For my mother and myself there would be, as soon
as our neighbours' cows were milked, a cup of warm milk and
bread soaked in it. 'Tis a breakfast good for a grown person as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
well as for a child, and it costs us nothing but the trouble of going
to take it.</p>

<p>When I had swept the room and laid everything in its place I
went into the garden, hoe in hand, to weed the beds and trim the
borders. The garden was not very big, it is true, but it produced
many things useful for us; notably onions and sallet, besides many
herbs good for the house, for it was a fertile strip of ground and
planted in every part of it. Now, such was the beauty of the
morning and the softness of the air that I presently forgot the
work about which I had come into the garden, and sat down in the
shade upon a bench, suffering my thoughts to wander hither and
thither. Much have I always pitied those poor folk in towns who
can never escape from the noise and clatter of tongues and sit
somewhere in the sunshine or the shade, while the cattle low in
the meadows and the summer air makes the leaves to rustle, and
thus alone suffer their thoughts to wander here and there. Every
morning when I arose was this spectacle of Nature's gladness presented
to my eyes, but not every morning could my spirit (which
sometimes crawls, as if fearing the light of day and the face of the
sun) rise to meet and greet it, and to feel it calling aloud for a
hymn of praise and thanksgiving. For, indeed, this is a beautiful
world, if we could always (which we cannot for the earthliness of
our natures) suffer its loveliness to sink into our hearts. I know
not what I thought this morning; but I remember, while I considered
the birds, which neither reap nor sow, nor take any thought
of to-morrow, yet are daily fed by Heaven, that the words were
whispered in mine ear: 'Are ye not much better than they?' And
this, without doubt, prepared my heart for what should follow.</p>

<p>While I sat thinking of I know not what, there came footsteps&mdash;quick
footsteps&mdash;along the road; and I knew those footsteps, and
sprang to my feet, and ran to the garden-gate, crying, 'Robin!&mdash;it
is Robin!'</p>

<p>Yes; it was Robin.</p>

<p>He seized me by both hands, looking in my face curiously and
eagerly.</p>

<p>'Alice!' he said, drawing a deep breath, 'Oh! but what hath
happened to thee?'</p>

<p>'What should happen, Robin?'</p>

<p>'Oh! Thou art changed, Alice! I left thee almost a child,
and now&mdash;now&mdash;I thought to catch thee in my arms&mdash;a sweet rustic
nymph&mdash;and now&mdash;fain must I go upon my knees to a goddess.'</p>

<p>'Robin!' Who, indeed, would have expected such language
from Robin!</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 447px;">
<img src="images/i_085.jpg" width="447" height="600" alt="Robin" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">'<i>And Robin was come home again, and I was lying in his arms, and
he was kissing me.</i>'</p></div>
</div>

<p>'Alice,' he said, still gazing upon me with a kind of wonder
which made me blush, 'do you remember when we parted four
years ago&mdash;the words we said? As for me, I have never forgotten
them. I was to think of thee always; I was to love thee always.
Truly I may say that there is never a day but thou hast been in my
mind. But not like this'&mdash;&mdash;He continued to look upon me as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
upon some strange creature, so that I began to be frightened and
turned away.</p>

<p>'Nay, Alice, forgive me. I am one who is dazzled by the
splendour of the sun. Forgive me; I cannot speak. I thought of
a village beauty, rosy-cheeked, sweet and wholesome as an August
quarander, and I find'&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>'Robin&mdash;not a goddess.'</p>

<p>'Well, then, a woman tall and stately, and more beautiful than
words can say.'</p>

<p>'Nay, Robin, you do but flatter. That is not like the old
Robin I remember and'&mdash;&mdash;I should have added 'loved,' but the
word stuck.</p>

<p>'I swear, sweet saint&mdash;if I may swear&mdash;nay, then I do affirm,
that I do not flatter. Hear me tell a plain tale. I have travelled
far since last I saw thee; I have seen the great ladies of the Court
both of St. James's and of the Louvre; I have seen the famous
beauties of Provence, and the black-eyed witches of Italy; but
nowhere have I seen a woman half so fair.'</p>

<p>'Robin&mdash;you must not! Nay, Robin&mdash;you shame me!'</p>

<p>Then he knelt at my feet and seized my hand and kissed it.
Oh, the foolishness of a man in love! And yet it pleases us. No
woman is worth it. No woman can understand it; nor can she
comprehend the power and might of man's love, nor why he singles
out her alone from all the rest and fills his heart wholly with her,
so that all other women are henceforward as his sisters. It is wonderful;
it is most wonderful. Yet it pleases us. Nay, we cannot
choose but thank God for it with all our heart and with all our
soul.</p>

<p>I would not, if I could, set down all the things which Robin
said. First, because the words of love are sacred; next, because I
would not that other women should know the extravagance of his
praise. It was in broken words, because love can never be eloquent.</p>

<p>As for me, what could I do, what could I say? For I had loved
him from my very childhood, and now all my heart went out
from me and became his. I was all his. I was his slave to command.
That is the quality of earthly love by which it most closely
resembles the heavenly love, so that just as the godly man is
wholly devoted to the will of the Lord in all things great and
small, resigned to His chastisements, and always anxious to live
and die in His service, so in earthly love one must be wholly
devoted to the person whom one loves.</p>

<p>And Robin was come home again, and I was lying in his arms,
and he was kissing me and calling me all the sweet and tender
things that he could invent, and laughing and sighing together as
if too happy to be quiet. Oh! sweetest moments of my life!
Why did they pass so quickly? Oh! sacrament of love, which can
be taken only once, and yet changes the whole of life and fills it
with memory which is wholly sweet! In all other earthly things<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
there is something of bitterness. In this holy joy of pure and
sacred love there is no bitterness&mdash;no; not any. It leaves behind
nothing of reproach or of repentance, of shame or of sorrow. It
is altogether holy.</p>

<p>Now, when my boy had somewhat recovered from his first
rapture, and I had assured him very earnestly that I was not, indeed,
an angel, but a most sinful woman, daily offending in my
inner thoughts (an assurance which he received, indeed, with an
appearance of disbelief and scorn), I was able to consider his
appearance, which was now very fine, though always, as I learned
when I saw him among other gentlemen, with some soberness, as
became one whose upbringing inclined him to plainness of dress as
well as of speech and manner. He wore a long wig of brown hair,
which might have been his own but for its length; his hat was laced
and cocked, which gave him a gallant and martial appearance; his
neckcloth was long and of fine lace; beside him in my russet
gown I must have looked truly plain and rustic; but Robin was
pleased not to think so, and love is a great magician to cheat the
eyes.</p>

<p>He was home again; he told me he should travel no more (yet
you shall hear how far he afterwards travelled against his will);
his only desire now was to stay at home and live as his grandfather
had lived, in his native village; he had nothing to pray for but the
continuance of my love&mdash;of which, indeed, there was no doubt
possible.</p>

<p>It was now close upon six o'clock, and I begged him to go away
for the present, and if my father and Sir Christopher should agree,
and if it should seem to his Honour a fit and proper thing that
Robin should marry a girl so penniless as myself, why&mdash;then&mdash;we
might meet again after breakfast, or after dinner; or, indeed, at
any other time, and so discourse more upon the matter. So he left
me, being very reluctant to go; and I, forgetting my garden and
what I had come forth to do, returned to the house.</p>

<p>You must understand that all these things passed in the garden,
divided from the lane by a thick hedge, and that passers-by&mdash;but
there were none&mdash;could not, very well, have seen what was done,
though they might have heard what was said. But if my father
had looked out of his window he could have seen, and if my mother
had come downstairs she also might have seen through the window,
or through the open door. This I thought not upon, nor was
there anything to hide&mdash;though one would not willingly suffer
anyone, even one's own mother, to see and listen at such a
moment. Yet mother has since told me that she saw Robin on his
knees kissing my hands; but she withdrew, and would not look
again.</p>

<p>When I stepped within the door she was at work with her
wheel, and looked up with a smile upon her lips, but tears were
lying in her eyes. Had I known what she had seen I should have
been ashamed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span></p>

<p>'Daughter,' she said softly, 'thy cheek is burning red. Hast
thou, perchance, been too long in the sun?'</p>

<p>'No, mother, the sun is not too hot.'</p>

<p>'Daughter,' she went on, still smiling through her tears, 'thine
eyes are bright and glowing. Hast thou a touch of fever by ill
chance?'</p>

<p>'No, mother, I have no fever.'</p>

<p>'Child, thy lips are trembling and thy hands are shaking. My
dear, my dear, what is it? Tell thy mother all.'</p>

<p>She held out her arms to me, and I threw myself at her feet,
and buried my head in her lap as if I had been again a child.</p>

<p>'Mother! mother!' I cried, 'Robin hath come home again,
and he says he loves me, and nothing will do but he must marry
me.'</p>

<p>'My dear,' she said, kissing and fondling me, 'Robin hath
always been a good lad, and I doubt not that he hath returned unspotted
from the world; but, nay, do not let us be too sure. For,
first, his Honour must consent, and then Madam; and thy father
must be asked&mdash;and he would never, for any worldly honour&mdash;no,
never&mdash;suffer thee to marry an ungodly man. As for thy lack of
fortune, I know not if that will not also stand in the way; and as
for family, thy father, though he was born in New England, cometh
of a good stock, and I myself am a gentlewoman, and on both sides
we bear an ancient coat-of-arms. And as for thyself, my dear,
thou art&mdash;I thank God for it!&mdash;of a sweet temper and an obedient
disposition. From the earliest thou hast never given thy mother
any uneasiness, and I think thy heart hath been mercifully disposed
towards goodness from thy childhood upwards. It is a
special grace in this our long poverty and oppression; and it consoles
me partly for the loss of my son Barnaby.' Here she was silent
for a space, and her eyes filled and brimmed over. 'Daughter,'
she said earnestly, 'thou art comely in the eyes of men; that have
I known for long. It is partly for thy sweet looks that Sir Christopher
loves thee; Mr. Boscorel plays music with thee partly because
his eyes love to behold the beauty of woman. Nay, I mean
no reproach, because it is the nature of men to love all things
beautiful, whether it be the plumage of a bird or the shape of a
woman's head. Yes; thou art beautiful, my dear. Beauty passes,
but love remains. Thy husband will perchance never cease to
think thee lovely if he still proves daily thy goodness and the loveliness
of thy heart. My dear, thou hast long comforted thy mother;
now shalt thou go, with the blessing of the Lord, to be the solace
and the joy of thy husband.'</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII.</h2>

<h3>HUMPHREY.</h3>


<div class="drop">
<img src="images/i_090.jpg" alt="P" width="100" height="98" class="cap" />
 <p class="cap_1">Presently my father came in, the Bible in his hand.
By his countenance it was plain that he had been
already engaged in meditation, and that his mind was
charged as with a message.</p>
</div>

<p>Alas! to think of the many great discourses that
he pronounced (being as a dog who must be muzzled
should he leave the farm-yard) to us women alone. If they were
written down the world would lift up its hands with wonder, and
ask if a prophet indeed had been vouchsafed to this unhappy
country. The Roman Church will have that the time of Saints did
not end with the last of the Apostles; that may be, and yet a Saint
has no more power after death than remains in his written words
and in the memory of his life. Shall we not, however, grant that
there may still be Prophets, who see and apprehend the meaning of
words and of things more fully than others even as spiritually
minded as themselves? Now, I say, considering what was immediately
to befall us, the passage which my father read and expounded
that morning was in a manner truly prophetic. It was the vision
of the Basket of Summer Fruit which was vouchsafed to the Prophet
Amos. He read to us that terrible chapter&mdash;everybody knows it,
though it hath but fourteen verses.</p>

<p>'I will turn your feasts into mourning and all your songs into
lamentation.... I will send a famine in the land; not a
famine of bread nor a thirst for water, but of hearing the words of
the Lord.'</p>

<p>He then applied the chapter to these times, saying that the
Scriptures and the prophecies apply not only to the Israel of the
time when Amos or any other prophet lived, but to the people of
God in all ages, yet so that sometimes one prophet seems to deliver
the message that befits the time and sometimes another. All these
things prophesied by Amos had come to pass in this country of
Great Britain; so that there was, and had now been for twenty-five
years, a grievous famine and a sore thirst for the words of the
Lord. He continued to explain and to enlarge upon this topic for
nearly an hour, when he concluded with a fervent prayer that the
famine would pass away and the sealed springs be open again for
the children of grace to drink and be refreshed.</p>

<p>This done, he took his breakfast in silence, as was his wont,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
loving not to be disturbed by any earthly matters when his mind
was full of his morning discourse. When he had eaten the bread
and meat and taken the cup of cider, he arose and went back to his
own room, and shut the door. We should have no more speech of
him until dinner-time.</p>

<p>'I will speak with him, my dear,' said my mother. 'But not
yet. Let us wait till we hear from Sir Christopher.'</p>

<p>'I would that my father had read us a passage of encouragement
and promise on this morning of all mornings,' I said.</p>

<p>My mother turned over the leaves of the Bible. 'I will read
you a verse of encouragement,' she said. 'It is the word of God
as much as the Book of the Prophet Amos.' So she found and
read for my comfort words which had a new meaning to me:&mdash;</p>

<p>'My beloved spake, and said unto me, Rise up, my love, my
fair one, and come away. For, lo! the winter is past, the rain is
over and gone; the flowers appear on the earth; the time of the
singing of birds is come, and the voice of the turtle is heard in our
land. The fig tree putteth forth her green figs, and the vines with
the tender grape give a good smell. Arise, my love, my fair one,
and come away.'</p>

<p>And again, these that follow:&mdash;</p>

<p>'Set me as a seal upon thine heart, as a seal upon thine arm: for
love is strong as death; jealousy is cruel as the grave: the coals
thereof are coals of fire, which hath a most vehement flame. Many
waters cannot quench love, neither can the floods drown it. If a
man would give all the substance of his house for love it would
utterly be contemned.'</p>

<p>In these gracious, nay, these enraptured words, doth the Bible
speak of love; and though I am not so ignorant as not to know
that it is the love of the Church for Christ, yet I am persuaded by
my own spiritual experience&mdash;whatever Doctors of Divinity may
argue&mdash;that the earthly love of husband and wife may be spoken of
in these very words as being the type of that other and higher love.
And in this matter I know that my mother would also confirm my
judgment.</p>

<p>It might have been between nine and ten that Humphrey came.
Surely he was changed more than Robin: for the great white
periwig which he wore (being now a physician) falling upon his
shoulders did partly hide the deformity of his wry shape, and the
black velvet coat did also become him mightily. As for his face,
that was not changed at all. It had been grave and serious in
youth; it was now more grave and more serious in manhood. He
stood in the doorway, not seeing me&mdash;I was making a pudding for
dinner, with my sleeves rolled up and my arms white with flour.</p>

<p>'Mistress Eykin,' he said, 'are old friends passed out of mind?'</p>

<p>'Why,' my mother left her wheel and gave him her hand, ''tis
Humphrey! I knew that we should see thee this morning,
Humphrey. Is thy health good, my son, and is all well with
thee?'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span></p>

<p>'All is well, madam, and my health is good. How is my
master&mdash;thy husband?'</p>

<p>'He is always well, and&mdash;but thou knowest what manner of life
he leads. Of late he hath been much disquieted; he is restless&mdash;his
mind runs much upon the prophecies of war and pestilence. It
is the news from London and the return of the Mass which keeps
him uneasy. Go in and see him, Humphrey. He will willingly
suffer thee to disturb him, though we must not go near him in his
hours of study.'</p>

<p>'Presently; but where is my old playfellow&mdash;where is Alice?'</p>

<p>'She is behind you, Humphrey.'</p>

<p>He turned, and his pale face flushed when he saw me.</p>

<p>'Alice?' he cried. 'Is this truly Alice? Nay, she is changed
indeed! I knew not&mdash;I could not expect&mdash;nay, how could one
expect'&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>'There is no change,' said my mother, sharply. 'Alice was a
child, and is now a woman; that is all.'</p>

<p>'Humphrey expects,' I said, 'that we should all stop still while
Time went on. You were to become a Bachelor of Medicine, sir,
and a Fellow of All Souls' College, and to travel in Italy and
France, and to come back in a velvet coat, and a long sword, and a
periwig over your shoulders; and I was to be a little girl still.'</p>

<p>Humphrey shook his head.</p>

<p>'It is not only that,' he said; 'though I confess that one did
not make due allowance for the flight of Time. It is that the
sweet-faced child has become'&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>'No, Humphrey,' I said, 'I want no compliments. Go now,
sir, and speak with my father. Afterwards you shall tell me all
that you have been doing.'</p>

<p>He obeyed, and opened my father's door.</p>

<p>'Humphrey!' My father sprang to his feet. 'Welcome, my
pupil! Thou bringest good news? Nay; I have received thy
letters: I read the good news in thy face&mdash;I see it in thine eyes.
Welcome home!'</p>

<p>'Sir, I have, indeed, great news,' said Humphrey.</p>

<p>Then the door was closed.</p>

<p>He stayed there for half an hour and more; and we heard from
within earnest talk&mdash;my father's voice sometimes uplifted, loud
and angry, but Humphrey's always low, as if he did not wish
us to overhear them. So, not to seem unto each other as if we
were listening, mother and I talked of other things, such as the
lightness of the pudding, and the quantity of suet which should be
put into it, and the time it should boil in the pot, and other
things, as women can whose hearts are full, yet they must needs be
talking.</p>

<p>'Father hath much to say to Humphrey,' I said, after a time;
'he doth not use to like such interruption.'</p>

<p>'Humphrey's conversation is no interruption, my dear. They
think the same thoughts and talk the same language. Your father<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
may teach and admonish us, but he can only converse with a
scholar such as himself. It is not the least evil of our oppression
that he hath been cut off from the society of learned men, in
which he used to take so much delight. If Humphrey remains
here a little while you shall see your father lose the eager and
anxious look which hath of late possessed him. He will talk to
Humphrey, and will clear his mind. Then he will be contented
again for a while, or, at least, resigned.'</p>

<p>Presently Humphrey came forth. His face was grave and
serious. My father came out of the room after him.</p>

<p>'Let us talk more,' he said; 'let us resume our talk. Join
me on the hillside, where none can hear us. It is, indeed, the
Vision of the Basket of Summer Fruit that we read this morning.'
His face was working with some inward excitement, and his eyes
were full of a strange light as of a glad conqueror, or of one&mdash;forbid
the thought!&mdash;who was taking a dire revenge. He strode
down the garden and out into the lanes.</p>

<p>'Thus,' said my mother, 'will he walk out, and sometimes
remain in the woods, walking, preaching to the winds, and swinging
his arms the whole day long. Art thou a physician, and canst
thou heal him, Humphrey?'</p>

<p>'If the cause be removed, the disease will be cured. Perhaps
before long the cause will be removed.'</p>

<p>'The cause&mdash;oh! the cause&mdash;what is the cause but the tyranny
of the Law? He who was ordered by Heaven itself to preach
hath been, perforce, silent for five-and-twenty years. His very
life hath been taken from him. And you talk of removing the
cause!'</p>

<p>'Madam, if the Law suffer him once more to preach freely,
would that satisfy him&mdash;and you?'</p>

<p>My mother shook her head. 'The Law,' she said, 'now we
have a Papist on the throne is far more likely to lead my husband to
the stake than to set him free.'</p>

<p>'That shall we shortly see,' said Humphrey.</p>

<p>My mother bent her head over her wheel as one who wishes to
talk no more upon the subject. She loved not to speak concerning
her husband to any except to me.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>I went out into the garden with Humphrey. I was foolish. I
laughed at nothing. I talked nonsense. Oh! I was so happy
that if a pipe and tabor had been heard in the village I should
have danced to the music, like poor Barnaby the night before he
ran away. I regarded not the grave and serious face of my companion.</p>

<p>'You are merry, Alice,' said Humphrey.</p>

<p>'It is because you are come back again&mdash;you and Robin. Oh!
the time has been long and dull&mdash;and now you have come back we
shall all be happy again. Yes; my father will cease to fret and
rage; he will talk Latin and Greek with you; Sir Christopher will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
be happy only in looking upon you; Madam will have her son
home again; and Mr. Boscorel will bring out all the old music for
you. Humphrey, it is a happy day that brings you home again.'</p>

<p>'It may be a happy day also for me,' he said; 'but there is
much to be done. When the business we have in hand is accomplished'&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>'What business, Humphrey?' For he spoke so gravely that
it startled me.</p>

<p>''Tis business of which thy father knows, child. Nay; let us
not talk of it. I think and hope that it is as good as accomplished
now before it is well taken in hand. It is not of that business
that I would speak. Alice, thou art so beautiful and so tall'&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>'Nay, Humphrey. I must not be flattered.'</p>

<p>'And I so crooked.'</p>

<p>'Humphrey, I will not hear this talk. You, so great a scholar,
thus to speak of yourself!'</p>

<p>'Let me speak of myself, my dear. Hear me for a moment.'
I declare that I had not the least thought of what he was going to
say, my mind being wholly occupied with the idea of Robin.</p>

<p>'I am a physician, as you doubtless know. I am MedicinÃ¦
Doctor of Oxford, of Padua, Montpellier, and Leyden. I know
all&mdash;I may fairly say, and without boasting&mdash;that may be learned
by one of my age from schools of medicine and from books on the
science and practice of healing. I believe, in short, that I am as
good a physician as can be found within these seas. I am minded,
as soon as tranquillity is restored, to set up as a physician in London,
where I have already many friends, and am assured of some
support. I think, humbly speaking, that reasonable success awaits
me. Alice&mdash;you know that I have loved you all my life&mdash;will you
marry me, crooked as I am? Oh! you cannot but know that I
have loved you all my life. Oh! child,' he stretched forth his
hands, and in his eyes there was a world of longing and of sadness
which moved my heart. 'My dear, the crooked in body have no
friends among men; they cannot join in their rough sports, nor
drink with them, nor fight with them. They have no chance of
happiness but in love, my dear. My dear, give me that chance.
I love thee! Oh! my dear, give me that chance?'</p>

<p>Never had I seen Humphrey so moved before. I felt guilty
and ashamed in the presence of this passion of which I was the
most unworthy cause.</p>

<p>'Oh! Humphrey, stop&mdash;for Heaven's sake stop!&mdash;because I am
but this very morning promised to Robin, who loves me, too&mdash;and
I love Robin, Humphrey.' He sank back, pale and disordered,
and I thought that he would swoon, but he recovered. 'Humphrey,
never doubt that I love you, too. But oh! I love Robin,
and Robin loves me.'</p>

<p>'Yes, dear&mdash;yes, child&mdash;yes, Alice,' he said in broken accents.
'I understand. Everything is for Robin&mdash;everything for Robin.
Why, I might have guessed it! For Robin, the straight and comely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
figure; for Robin, the strength; for Robin, the inheritance; for
Robin, happy love. For me, a crooked body; for me, a feeble
frame; for me, the loss of fortune; for me, contempt and poverty;
for me, the loss of love&mdash;all for Robin&mdash;all for Robin!'</p>

<p>'Humphrey, surely thou wouldst not envy or be jealous of
Robin!' Never had I seen him thus moved, or heard him thus
speak.</p>

<p>He made no answer for a while. Then he said, slowly and
painfully:&mdash;</p>

<p>'Alice, I am ashamed. Why should not Robin have all? Who
am I that I should have anything? Forgive me, child. I have
lived in a paradise which fools create for themselves. I have suffered
myself to dream that what I ardently desired was possible
and even probable. Forgive me. Let me be as before&mdash;your
brother. Will you forgive me, dear?'</p>

<p>'Oh, Humphrey! there is nothing for me to forgive.'</p>

<p>'Nay, there is much for me to repent of. Forget it then, if
there is nothing to forgive.'</p>

<p>'I have forgotten it already, Humphrey.'</p>

<p>'So'&mdash;he turned upon me his grave, sweet face (to think of it
makes me yearn with tenderness and pity)&mdash;'so, farewell, fond
dream! Do not think, my dear, that I envy Robin. 'Twas a sweet
dream! Yet, I pray that Heaven in wrath may forget me if ever I
suffer this passion of envy to hurt my cousin Robin or thyself!'</p>

<p>So saying, he burst from me with distraction in his face. Poor
Humphrey! Alas! when I look back and consider this day, there
is a doubt which haunts me. Always had I loved Robin: that is
most true. But I had always loved Humphrey: that is most true.
What if it had been Humphrey instead of Robin who had arisen
in the early morning to find his sweetheart in the garden when the
dew was yet upon the grass?</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII.</h2>

<h3>ONE DAY.</h3>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 249px;">
<img src="images/i_096.jpg" width="249" height="350" alt="Happy" />
</div>

<p>In times of great sorrow the
godly person ought to look
forward to the never-ending
joy and happiness that will
follow this short life. Yet we
still look backwards to the
happy time that is past and
can never come again. And
then, how happy does it seem
to have been in comparison
with present affliction!</p>

<p>It pleased Heaven after
many trials to restore my
earthly happiness&mdash;at least,
in its principal part, which
is earthly love. Some losses&mdash;grievous
and lamentable&mdash;there
were which could not
be restored. Yet for a long
time I had no other comfort
(apart from that hope which I
trust was never suffered to leave me) than the recollection
of one single day in its course, too short, from dewy
morn till dusky eve. I began that day with the sweetest
joy that a girl can ever experience&mdash;namely, the return
of her lover and the happiness of learning that he loves her more
than ever, with the knowledge that her heart hath gone forth from
her and is wholly his. To such a girl the woods and fields become
the very garden of Eden; the breath of the wind is as the voice of
the Lord blessing another Eve; the very showers are the tears of
gladness and gratitude; the birds sing hymns of praise; the leaves
of the trees whisper words of love; the brook prattles of kisses;
the flowers offer incense; the royal course of the sun in splendour,
the glories of the sunrise and sunset, the twinkling stars of night,
the shadows of the flying clouds, the pageant of the summer day&mdash;these
are all prepared for that one happy girl and for her happy
lover! Oh, Divine Gift of Love! which thus gives the whole world<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
with its fruits in season to each pair in turn! Nay, doth it not
create them anew? What was Adam without Eve? And Eve was
created for no other purpose than to be a companion to the man.</p>

<p>I say, then, that the day when Robin took me in his arms and
kissed me&mdash;not as he had done when we parted and I was still a
child, but with the fervent kiss of a lover&mdash;was the happiest day
in all my life. I say that I have never forgotten that day, but, by
recalling any point of it, I remember all: how he held my hand
and how he made me confess that I loved him; how we kissed and
parted, to meet again. As for poor Humphrey, I hardly gave him
so much as a thought of pity. Then, how we wandered along the
brook hand in hand!</p>

<p>'Never to part again, my dear,' said the fond lover. 'Here
will we live, and here we will die. Let Benjamin become, if he
please, Lord Chancellor, and Humphrey a great physician: they
will have to live among men in towns, where every other man is a
rogue. We shall live in this sweet country place, where the people
may be rude but they are not knaves. Why, in that great city of
London, where the merchants congregate upon the Exchange and
look so full of dignity and wisdom, each man is thinking all the
time that, if he fail to overreach his neighbour, that neighbour
will overreach him. Who would live such a life when he can pass
it in the fields with such a companion as my Alice?'</p>

<p>The pleasures of London had only increased his thirst for the
country life. Surely, never was seen a swain more truly rustic in
all his thoughts! The fine ladies at the playhouse, with their
painted faces, made him, he told me, think of one who wore a russet
frock in Somersetshire, and did not paint her sweet face&mdash;this was
the way he talked. The plays they acted could never even be read,
much less witnessed, by that dear girl&mdash;so full of wickedness they
were. At the assemblies the ladies were jealous of each other, and
put on scornful looks when one seemed preferred; at the taverns
the men drank and bellowed songs and quarrelled; in the streets
they fought and took the wall and swaggered; there was nothing
but fighting among the baser sort, with horrid imprecations; at
the coffee-houses the politicians argued and quarrelled. Nay, in
the very churches the sermons were political arguments, and while
the clergyman read his discourse the gallants ogled the ladies. All
this and more he told me.</p>

<p>To hear my boy, one would think there was nothing in London
but what was wicked and odious. No doubt it is a wicked place;
where many men live together, those who are wicked easily find
each other out, and are encouraged in their wickedness. Yet there
must be many honest and God-fearing persons, otherwise the Judgment
of Heaven would again fall upon that city as it did in the
time of the Plague and in the Great Fire.</p>

<p>'My pretty Puritan,' said Robin, 'I am now come away from
that place, and I hope never to see it again. Oh! native hills, I
salute you! Oh! woods and meadows, I have returned, to wander<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
again in your delightful shade.' Then, which was unusual in my
boy, and would have better become Mr. Boscorel or Humphrey, he
began to repeat verses. I knew not that he had ever learned
any:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">As I range these spacious fields,</span>
<span class="i0">Feast on all that Nature yields;</span>
<span class="i0">Everything inspires delight,</span>
<span class="i0">Charms my smell, my taste, my sight;</span>
<span class="i0">Every rural sound I hear</span>
<span class="i0">Soothes my soul and tunes my ear.</span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>I do not know where Robin found these verses, but as he repeated
them, waving his arm around, I thought that Humphrey
himself never made sweeter lines.</p>

<p>He then told me how Humphrey would certainly become the
most learned physician of the time, and that he was already master
of a polite and dignified manner which would procure him the
patronage of the great and the confidence of all. It was pleasant
to hear him praise his cousin without jealousy or envy. To be
sure, he knew not then&mdash;though afterwards I told him&mdash;that Humphrey
was his rival. Even had he known this, such was the candour
of my Robin and the integrity of his soul that he would have
praised him even more loudly.</p>

<p>One must not repeat more of the kind and lovely things that
the dear boy said while we strolled together by the brook-side.</p>

<p>While thus abroad we walked&mdash;'twas in the forenoon, after
Humphrey's visit&mdash;Sir Christopher, his grandfather, dressed in his
best coat and his gold-laced hat, which he commonly kept for
church, and accompanied by Madam, walked from the Manor
House through the village till they came to our cottage. Then,
with great ceremony, they entered, Sir Christopher bowing low
and Madam dropping a deep courtesy to my mother, who sat
humbly at her wheel.</p>

<p>'Madam,' said Sir Christopher, 'we would, with your permission,
say a few words with the learned Dr. Eykin and yourself.'</p>

<p>My father, who had now returned and was in his room, came
forth when he was called. His face had recovered something of
its serenity, but his eyes were still troubled. Madam sat down,
but Sir Christopher and my father stood.</p>

<p>'Sir,' said his Honour, 'I will proceed straight to the point.
My grandson desires to marry your daughter Alice. Robin is a
good lad&mdash;not a scholar if you will&mdash;for his religion, the root of the
matter is in him; for the goodness of his heart I will answer; for
his habit of life, he hath, so far as we can learn, acquired no vile
vices of the city&mdash;he doth neither drink nor gamble, nor waste his
health and strength in riotous living; and for his means they are
my own. All that I have will be his. 'Tis no great estate, but
'twill serve him as it hath served me. Sir, the boy's mother and I
have come to ask your daughter in marriage. We know her worth,
and we are right well satisfied that our boy hath made so good and
wise a choice.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span></p>

<p>'They were marrying and giving in marriage when the Flood
came; they will be marrying and giving in marriage in the Great
Day of the Lord,' said my father.</p>

<p>'Yes, gossip; but that is no reason why they should not now
be marrying and giving in marriage.'</p>

<p>'You ask my consent?' said my father. 'This surprises me.
The child is too young: she is not yet of marriageable age'&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>'Husband, she is nigh upon her twentieth birthday!'</p>

<p>'I thought she had been but twelve or thereabouts! My consent?
Why, Sir Christopher, in the eyes of the world this is
great condescension on your part to take a penniless girl. I looked,
I suppose, to the marriage of my daughter some time&mdash;perhaps to
a farmer&mdash;yet&mdash;yet, we are told that a virtuous woman hath a
price far above rubies; and that it is she who buildeth up the
house, and we are nowhere told that she must bring her husband
a purse of gold. Sir Christopher, it would be the blackest ingratitude
in us to deny you, even if this thing were (which I say not)
against the mind of our daughter.'</p>

<p>'It is not&mdash;it is not,' said my mother.</p>

<p>'Wherefore, seeing that the young man is a good man as youths
go, though in the matter of the Latin syntax he hath yet much to
learn; and that his heart is disposed towards religion, I am right
glad that he should take our girl to wife.'</p>

<p>'Bravely said!' cried Sir Christopher. 'Hands upon it, man!
And we will have a merry wedding. But to-day I bid you both to
come and feast with us. We will have holiday and rejoicing.'</p>

<p>'Yes,' said my father, 'we will feast; though to-morrow comes
the Deluge.' I know now what he meant, but at that time we
knew not, and it seemed to his Honour a poor way of rejoicing at
the return of the boys and the betrothal of his daughter thus to be
foretelling woes. 'The Vision of the Plumb-line is before mine
eyes,' my father went on. 'Is the land able to bear all this? We
talk of feasting and of marriages. Yet a few days, or perhaps
already&mdash;&mdash;But we will rejoice together, my old friend and benefactor,
we will rejoice together.' With these strange words he
turned and went back to his room, and after some tears with
my mother, Madam went home and Sir Christopher with her. But
in honour to the day he kept on his best coat.</p>

<p>Robin suffered me to go home, but only that I might put on
my best frock (I had but two) and make my hair straight, which
had been blown into curls, as was the way with my hair. And then,
learning from my mother with the utmost satisfaction what had
passed, he led me by the hand, as if I were already his bride, and
so to the Manor House, where first Sir Christopher saluted me
with great kindness, calling me his dear granddaughter, and saying
that next to Robin's safe return he asked for nothing more
than to see me Robin's wife. And Madam kissed me, with tears
in her eyes, and said that she could desire nothing better for her
son, and that she was sure I should do my best endeavours to make<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
the boy happy. Then Humphrey, as quietly as if he had not also
asked me to be his wife, kissed my hand, and wished me joy; and
Mr. Boscorel also kissed me, and declared that Robin ought to be
the happiest dog on earth. And so we sat down to our feast.</p>

<p>The conversation at dinner was graver than the occasion demanded.
For though our travellers continually answered questions
about the foreign lands and peoples they had seen, yet the
subject returned always to the condition of the country, and to
what would happen.</p>

<p>After dinner we sat in the garden, and the gentlemen began to
talk of Right Divine and of Non-Resistance, and here it seemed
to me as if Mr. Boscorel was looking on as from an eminence apart.
For when he had once stated the texts and arguments upon which
the High Church party do mostly rely, he retired and made no
further objections, listening in silence while my father held forth
upon the duty of rising against wicked princes. At last, however,
being challenged to reply by Humphrey, Mr. Boscorel thus made
answer:</p>

<p>'The doctrine that subjects may or may not rebel against their
Sovereign is one which I regard with interest so long as it remains
a question of logic and argument only. Unfortunately, the times
are such that we may be called upon to make a practical application
of it: in which case there may follow once more civil war,
with hard knocks on both sides, and much loss of things temporal.
Wherefore to my learned brother's arguments, which I admit to be
plausible, I will, for the present, offer no reply, except to pray
Heaven that the occasion may not arise of converting a disputed
doctrine into a rule of conduct.'</p>

<p>Alas! even while he spoke the messenger was speeding swiftly
towards us who was to call upon all present to take a side.</p>

<p>The question is now, I hope, decided for ever: but many men
had first to die. It was not decided then, but three years later,
when King William cut the knot, and, with the applause of the
nation, pulled down his father-in-law, and mounted the throne
himself with his gracious consort. We are agreed, at last, that
kings, like judges, generals, and all great officers of State, are to
hold their offices in good behaviour. If they enter into machinations
against the liberty of the people and desert the national
religion, they must descend, and let others take their place. But
before that right could be established for the country, streams of
blood must first flow.</p>

<p>While they talked, we&mdash;I mean Madam, my mother, and myself&mdash;sat
and listened. But my mind was full of another subject, and
I heard but little of what was said, noting chiefly the fiery ardour
of my father and the careless grace of Mr. Boscorel.</p>

<p>Presently my father, who was never easy in the company of Mr.
Boscorel&mdash;(so oil and water will not agree to fill a cup in friendship)&mdash;and,
besides, being anxious to rejoin the society of his books,
arose and went away, and with him my mother&mdash;he, in his ragged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
cassock, who was a learned scholar; she in her plain home-spun,
who was a gentlewoman by birth. Often had I thought of our
poverty with bitterness. But now it was with a softened heart
that I saw them walk side by side across the lawns. For now I understood
plainly&mdash;and for the first time&mdash;how love can strengthen and
console. My mother was poor, but she was not therefore unhappy.</p>

<p>Mr. Boscorel also rose and went away with Humphrey. They
went to talk of things more interesting to the Rector than the
doctrine of Non-Resistance: of painting, namely, and statuary
and medals. And when we presently walked from the Rectory
gardens we heard a most gladsome scraping of fiddlestrings within,
which showed that the worthy man was making the most of
Humphrey's return.</p>

<p>When Sir Christopher had taken his pipe of tobacco he fell
asleep. Robin and I walked in the garden and renewed our vows.
Needs must that I should tell him all that I had done or thought
since he went away. As if the simple thoughts of a country maid
should be of interest to a man! Yet he seemed pleased to question
and to listen, and presently broke into a rapture, swearing that he
was in love with an angel. Young lovers, it is feared, may fall into
grievous sin by permitting themselves these extravagances of speech
and thought; yet it is hard to keep them sober, and besides
(because every sin in man meeteth with its correspondent in
woman), if the lover be extravagant, the maiden takes pleasure in
his extravagance. To call a mortal, full of imperfections, an angel,
is little short of blasphemy. Yet I heard it with, I confess, a
secret pleasure. We know ourselves and the truth concerning ourselves;
we do not deceive ourselves as to our imperfections; yet
we are pleased that our lovers should so speak and think of us as if
we were angels indeed.</p>

<p>Robin told me, presently ceasing his extravagances for a while,
that he was certain something violent was on foot. To be sure,
everybody expected so much. He said, moreover, that he believed
Humphrey had certain knowledge of what was going to happen;
that before they left the Low Countries Humphrey had been present
at a meeting of the exiles in Rotterdam, where it was well known
that Lord Argyle's expedition was resolved upon; that he had been
much engaged in London after their return, and had paid many
visits, the nature of which he kept secret; and that on the road
there was not a town and scarcely a village where Humphrey had
not someone to visit.</p>

<p>'My dear,' he said, 'Humphrey is slight as to stature and
strength, but he carries a stout heart. There is no man more bitter
against the King than he, and none more able if his counsels were
listened to. Monmouth, I am certain, purposes to head an expedition
into England like that of Lord Argyle in Scotland. The history of
England hath many instances of such successful attempts. King
Stephen, King Henry IV., King Henry VII., are all examples. If<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
Monmouth lands, Humphrey will join him, I am sure. And I, my
dear'&mdash;&mdash;he paused.</p>

<p>'And you too, Robin? Oh! must you too go forth to fight?
And yet, if the Duke doth head a rising all the world would follow.
Oh! to drive away the Papist King and restore our liberty!'</p>

<p>'My dear, I will do what my grandfather approves. If it be
my duty to go, he will send me forth.'</p>

<p>I had almost forgotten to say that Madam took me to her own
chamber, where she opened a box and pulled out a gold chain, very
fine. This she hung about my neck, and bade me sit down, and gave
me some sound advice, reminding me that woman was the weaker
vessel, and should look to her husband not only to love and cherish
her, but also to prevent her from falling into certain grievous sins,
as of temper, deceitfulness, vanity, and the like, to which the
weaker nature is ever prone. Many other things she said, being a
good and virtuous woman, but I pass them over.</p>

<p>After supper we went again into the garden, the weather being
warm and fine. The sun went down, but the sky was full of light,
though it was past nine o'clock and time for me to go home and to
bed. Yet we lingered. The birds had gone to sleep; there was
no whisper of the wind; the village was in silence. And Robin
was whispering in my ear. I remember&mdash;I remember the very
tones of his voice, which was low and sweet. I remember the words
he said: 'Sweet love! Sweet love! How could I live so long without
thee!' I remember my swelling heart and my glowing cheeks.
Oh! Robin&mdash;Robin! Oh! poor heart! poor maid! The memory
of this one day was nearly all thou hadst to feed upon for so long&mdash;so
long a time!</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV.</h2>

<h3>THE VISION OF THE BASKET.</h3>


<div class="drop">
<img src="images/i_103.jpg" alt="S" width="100" height="99" class="cap" />
 <p class="cap_1">Suddenly we heard footsteps, as of those who are
running, and my father's voice speaking loud.</p>
</div>

<p>'Sing, O Daughter of Zion! Shout, O Israel!
Be glad and rejoice with all the heart!'&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>'Now, in the name of Heaven,' cried Sir Christopher,
'what meaneth this?'</p>

<p>'The Arm of the Lord! The Deliverance of Israel!'</p>

<p>He burst upon us, dragging a man with him by the arm. In
the twilight I could only see, at first, that it was a broad, thick-set
man. But my father's slender form looked taller as he waved his
arms and cried aloud. Had he been clad in a sheepskin, he would
have resembled one of those ancient Prophets whose words were
always in his mouth.</p>

<p>'Good friend,' said Sir Christopher, 'what meaneth these cries?
Whom have we here?'</p>

<p>Then the man with my father stepped forward and took off his
hat. Why, I knew him at once; though it was ten years since I
had seen him last! 'Twas my brother Barnaby&mdash;none other&mdash;come
home again. He was now a great strong man&mdash;a stouter have I
never seen, though he was somewhat under the middle height,
broad in the shoulders, and thick of chest. Beside him Robin,
though reasonable in breadth, showed like a slender sapling. But
he had still the same good-natured face, though now much broader.
It needed no more than the first look to know my brother Barnaby
again.</p>

<p>'Barnaby,' I cried, 'Barnaby, hast thou forgotten me?' I
caught one of his great hands&mdash;never, surely, were there bigger
hands than Barnaby's! 'Hast thou forgotten me?'</p>

<p>'Why,' he said slowly&mdash;'twas ever a boy slow of speech and of
understanding&mdash;'belike,'tis Sister.' He kissed my forehead. 'It
is Sister,' he said, as if he were tasting a cup of ale and was pronouncing
on its quality. 'How dost thou, Sister? Bravely, I
hope. Thou art grown, Sister. I have seen my mother, and&mdash;and&mdash;she
does bravely, too; though I left her crying. 'Tis their way,
the happier they be.'</p>

<p>'Barnaby?' said Sir Christopher, 'is it thou, scapegrace? Where
hast thou&mdash;&mdash;But first tell us what has happened. Briefly, man.'</p>

<p>'In two words, Sir: the Duke of Monmouth landed the day<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
before yesterday at Lyme Regis with my Lord Grey and a company
of a hundred&mdash;of whom I was one.'</p>

<p>The Duke had landed! Then what Robin expected had come
to pass! And my brother Barnaby was with the insurgents! My
heart beat fast.</p>

<p>'The Duke of Monmouth hath landed!' Sir Christopher repeated,
and sat down again, as one who knows not what may be the meaning
of the news.</p>

<p>'Ay, Sir, the Duke hath landed. We left Holland on the 24th
of May, and we made the coast at Lyme at daybreak on Thursday
the 11th. 'Tis now, I take it, Saturday. The Duke had with him
on board ship Lord Grey, Mr. Andrew Fletcher of Saltoun, Mr.
Heywood Dare of Taunton'&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>'I know the man,' said Sir Christopher, 'for an impudent, loud-tongued
fellow.'</p>

<p>'Perhaps he was, Sir,' said Barnaby, gravely. 'Perhaps he was,
but now'&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>'How "was"?'</p>

<p>'He was shot on Thursday evening by Mr. Fletcher for offering
him violence with a cane, and is now dead.'</p>

<p>''Tis a bad beginning. Go on, Barnaby.'</p>

<p>'The Duke had also Mr. Ferguson, Colonel Venner, Mr. Chamberlain,
and others whom I cannot remember. First we set Mr.
Dare and Mr. Chamberlain ashore at Seatown, whence they were
to carry intelligence of the rising to the Duke's friends. The Duke
landed at seven o'clock with his company, in seven boats. First,
he fell on his knees and prayed aloud. Then he drew his sword,
and we all marched after to the market-place, where he raised his
flag and caused the Declaration to be read. Here it is, your Honour.'
He lugged out a copy of the Declaration, which Sir Christopher
put aside, saying that he would read it in the morning.</p>

<p>'Then we tossed our hats and shouted "A Monmouth! A
Monmouth!" Sixty stout young fellows 'listed on the spot. Then
we divided our forces, and began to land the cannon&mdash;four pretty
pieces as you could wish to see&mdash;and the arms, of which I doubt if
we have enough, and the powder&mdash;two hundred and fifty barrels.
The Duke lay on Thursday night at the George. Next day, before
dawn, the country people began flocking in.'</p>

<p>'What gentlemen have come in?'</p>

<p>'I know not, Sir&mdash;my duty was most of the day on board. In
the evening I received leave to ride home, and indeed, Sir Christopher,
had orders to carry the Duke's Declaration to yourself. And
now we shall be well rid of the King, the Pope, and the Devil!'</p>

<p>'Because,' said my father, solemnly&mdash;'because with lies ye have
made the hearts of the righteous sad whom I have not made sad.'</p>

<p>'And what doest thou among this goodly company, friend
Barnaby?'</p>

<p>'I am to be a Captain in one of the regiments,' said Barnaby,
grinning with pride: 'though a sailor, yet can I fight with the best.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
My Colonel is Mr. Holmes; and my Major, Mr. Parsons. On
board the frigate I was master and navigated her.'</p>

<p>'There will be knocks, Barnaby; knocks, I doubt.'</p>

<p>'By your Honour's leave, I have been where knocks were flying
for ten years, and I will take my share, remembering still the
treatment of my father and the poverty of my mother.'</p>

<p>'It is rebellion, Barnaby!&mdash;rebellion!'</p>

<p>'Why, Sir, Oliver Cromwell was a rebel. And your Honour
fought in the army of the Earl of Essex&mdash;and what was he but a
rebel?'</p>

<p>I wondered to hear my brother speak with so much boldness,
who ten years before had bowed low and pulled his hair in presence
of his Honour. Yet Sir Christopher seemed to take this boldness
in good part.</p>

<p>'Barnaby,' he said, 'thou art a stout and proper lad, and I
doubt not thy courage&mdash;nay, I see it in thy face, which hath resolution
in it and yet is modest; no ruffler or boaster art thou, friend
Barnaby. Yet&mdash;yet&mdash;if rebellion fail&mdash;even rebellion in a just
cause&mdash;then those who rise lose their lives in vain, and the cause
is lost, until better times.' This he said as one who speaketh to
himself. I saw him look upon his grandson. 'The King is&mdash;a
Papist,' he said, 'that is most true. A Papist should not be
suffered to rule this country. Yet to rise in rebellion! Have a
care, lad! What if the time be not yet ripe? How know we who
will join the Duke?'</p>

<p>'The people are flocking to his standard by thousands,' said
Barnaby. 'When I rode away last night the Duke's secretaries
were writing down their names as fast as they could be entered;
they were landing the arms and already exercising the recruits.
And such a spirit they show, Sir, it would do your heart good only
once to witness!'</p>

<p>Now, as I looked at Barnaby, I became aware that he was not
only changed in appearance, but that he was also very finely
dressed&mdash;namely, in a scarlet coat and a sword with a silken sash,
with laced ruffles, a gold-laced hat, a great wig, white breeches, and
a flowered waistcoat. In the light of day, as I afterwards discovered,
there were stains of wine visible upon the coat, and the
ruffles were torn, and the waistcoat had marks upon it as of tar.
One doth not, to be sure, expect in the sailing master of a frigate
the same neatness as in a gallant of Saint James's. Yet, our runaway
lad must have prospered.</p>

<p>'What doth the Duke intend?' Sir Christopher asked him.</p>

<p>'Indeed, Sir, I know not. 'Tis said by some that he will raise
the West Country; and by some that he will march north into
Cheshire, where he hath many friends; and by others that he will
march upon London, and call upon all good Protestants to rise and
join him. We look to have an army of twenty thousand within a
week. As for the King, it is doubted whether he can raise a paltry
five thousand to meet us. Courage, Dad'&mdash;he dared to call his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
father, the Rev. Comfort Eykin, Doctor of Divinity, 'Dad!'&mdash;and
he clapped him lustily upon the shoulder; 'thou shalt mount the
pulpit yet, ay, of Westminster Abbey if it so please you!'</p>

<p>His father paid no heed to this conversation, being wrapt in his
own thoughts.</p>

<p>'I know not,' said Sir Christopher, 'what to think. The news
is sudden. And yet&mdash;and yet'&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>'We waste time,' cried my father, stamping his foot. 'Oh! we
waste the time talking. What helps it to talk? Every honest man
must now be up and doing. Why, it is a plain duty laid upon us.
The finger of Heaven is visible, I say, in this. Out of the very
sins of Charles Stuart hath the instrument for the destruction of his
race been forged. A plain duty, I say. As for me, I must preach
and exhort. As for my son, who was dead and yet liveth'&mdash;he
laid his hand upon Barnaby's shoulder&mdash;'time was when I prayed
that he might become a godly minister of God's Word. Now I
perceive clearly that the Lord hath ways of His own. My son shall
fight and I shall preach. Perhaps he will rise and become another
Cromwell!'&mdash;&mdash;Barnaby grinned.</p>

<p>'Sir,' said my father, turning hotly upon his Honour, 'I perceive
that thou art lukewarm. If the Cause be the Lord's, what
matter for the chances? The issue is in the hands of the Lord.
As for me and my household, we will serve the Lord. Yea, I
freely offer myself, and my son, and my wife, and my daughter&mdash;even
my tender daughter&mdash;to the Cause of the Lord. Young men
and maidens, old men and children, the Voice of the Lord
calleth!'</p>

<p>Nobody made reply; my father looked before him, as if he saw
in the twilight of the summer night a vision of what was to follow.
His face, as he gazed, changed. His eyes, which were fierce and
fiery, softened. His lips smiled. Then he turned his face and
looked upon each of us in turn&mdash;upon his son and upon his wife
and upon me, upon Robin and upon Sir Christopher. 'It is,
indeed,' he said, 'the Will of the Lord. Why, what though the
end be violent death to me, and to all of us ruin and disaster? We
do but share the afflictions foretold in the Vision of the Basket of
Summer Fruit. What is death? What is the loss of earthly things
compared with what shall follow to those who obey the Voice that
calls? Children, let us up and be doing. As for me, I shall have
a season of freedom before I die. For twenty-five years have I
been muzzled or compelled to whisper and mutter in corners and
hiding-places. I have been a dumb dog. I, whose heart was full
and overflowing with the sweet and precious Word of God; I, to
whom it is not life but death to sit in silence! Now I shall deliver
my soul before I die. Sirs, the Lord hath given to every man a
weapon or two with which to fight. To me he hath given an eye
and a tongue for discerning and proclaiming the word of sacred
doctrine. I have been muzzled&mdash;a dumb dog, I say&mdash;though sometimes
I have been forced to climb among the hills and speak to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
bending tree-tops. Now I shall be free again, and I will speak,
and all the ends of the earth shall hear.'</p>

<p>His eyes gleamed, he panted and gasped, and waved his arms.</p>

<p>'As for sister, Dad,' said Barnaby, 'she and mother may bide at
home.'</p>

<p>'No; they shall go with me. I offer my wife, my son, my
daughter, and myself to the Cause of the Lord.'</p>

<p>'A camp is but a rough place for a woman,' said Barnaby.</p>

<p>'She is offered; she is dedicated; she shall go with us.'</p>

<p>I know not what was in his mind, or why he wished that I
should go with him, unless it was a desire to give everything that
he had&mdash;to hold back nothing&mdash;to the Lord; therefore he would
give his children as well as himself. As for me, my heart glowed
to think that I was even worthy to join in such a Cause. What
could a woman do? But that I should find out.</p>

<p>'Robin,' I whispered, ''tis Religion calls. If I am to be among
the followers of the Duke, thou wilt not remain behind?'</p>

<p>'Child,'&mdash;it was my mother who whispered to me; I had not
seen her before&mdash;'Child, let us obey him. Perhaps it will be
better for him if we are at his side. And there is Barnaby. But
we must not be in their way. We shall find a place to sit aside and
wait. Alas! that my son hath returned to us only to go fighting.
We will go with them, daughter.'</p>

<p>'We should be better without women,' said Barnaby, grumbling;
'I would as lief have a woman on shipboard as in a camp. To be
sure, if Dad has set his heart upon it&mdash;and then he will not stay
long in camp, where the cursing of the men is already loud enough
to scare a preacher out of his cassock. Dad, I say'&mdash;&mdash;But my
father was fallen again into a kind of rapture, and heard nothing.</p>

<p>'When doth the Duke begin his march?' he said suddenly.</p>

<p>'I know not. But we shall find him, never fear.'</p>

<p>'I must have speech with him at the earliest possible time.
Hours are precious, and we waste them&mdash;we waste them.'</p>

<p>'Well, Sir, it is bedtime. To-morrow we can ride; unless,
because it is the Sabbath, you would choose to wait till Monday.
And as to the women, by your leave, it is madness to bring them to
a camp.'</p>

<p>'Wait till Monday? Art thou mad, Barnaby? Art thou mad?
Why, I have things to tell the Duke. Shall we waste eight precious
hours? Up! let us ride all night. To-morrow is the Sabbath, and
I will preach. Yea&mdash;I will preach. My soul longeth&mdash;yea, even it
fainteth, for the Courts of the Lord. Quick! quick! let us mount
and ride all night!'</p>

<p>At this moment Humphrey joined us.</p>

<p>'Lads,' said Sir Christopher, 'you are fresh from Holland.
Knew you aught of this?'</p>

<p>'Sir,' said Humphrey, 'I confess that I have already told Dr.
Eykin what to expect. I knew that the Duke was coming. Robin
did not know, because I would not drag him into the conspiracy.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
I knew that the Duke was coming, and that without delay. I have
myself had speech in Amsterdam with his Grace, who comes to
restore the Protestant religion and to give freedom of worship to all
good Protestant people. His friends have promises of support
everywhere. Indeed, Sir, I think that the expedition is well
planned, and is certain of support. Success is in the hands of the
Lord; but we do not expect that there will be any serious opposition.
With submission, Sir, I am under promise to join the Duke.
I came over in advance to warn his friends, as I rode from London,
of his approach. Thousands are waiting in readiness for him. But,
Sir, of all this, I repeat, Robin knew nothing. I have been for
three months in the counsels of those who desire to drive forth the
Popish King, but Robin have I kept in the dark.'</p>

<p>'Humphrey,' said Robin, reproachfully, 'am not I, also, a
Protestant?'</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XV.</h2>

<h3>A NIGHT AND MORNING.</h3>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 234px;">
<img src="images/i_109.jpg" width="234" height="350" alt="when" />
</div>

<p>When I read of men possessed by
some Spirit&mdash;that is to say,
compelled to go hither and
thither where, but for the
Spirit, they would not go,
and to say things which
they would not otherwise
have said&mdash;I think of our
midnight ride to Lyme, and
of my father there, and of
the three weeks' madness
which followed. It was
some Spirit&mdash;whether of good
or evil, I cannot say, and I
dare not so much as to question&mdash;which
seized him. That he
hurried away to join the Duke
on the first news of his landing,
without counting the cost
or weighing the chances, is easy
to be understood. Like Humphrey,
he was led by his knowledge of the
great numbers who hated the Catholic
religion to believe that they, like himself,
would rise with one accord. He also remembered
the successful rebellion against the first
Charles, and expected nothing less than a repetition
of that success. This, I know, was what the exiles in Holland
thought and believed. The Duke, they said, was the darling of the
people; he was the Protestant champion: who would not press
forward when he should draw the sword? But what other man&mdash;what
man in his sober senses would have dragged his wife and
daughter with him to the godless riot of a camp? Perhaps he
wanted them to share his triumph, to listen while he moved the
soldiers, as that ancient hermit Peter moved the people to the Holy
Wars? But I know not. He said that I was to be, like Jephthah's
daughter, consecrated to the Cause of the Lord; and what he meant
by that I never understood.</p>

<p>He was so eager to start upon the journey that he would not wait<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
a moment. The horses must be saddled; we must mount and
away. Mark that they were Sir Christopher's horses which we
borrowed; this also was noted afterwards for the ruin of that good
old man, with other particulars: as that Monmouth's Declaration
was found in the house (Barnaby brought it); one of Monmouth's
Captains, Barnaby Eykin by name, had ridden from Lyme to
Bradford in order to see him; he was a friend of the preacher Dr.
Eykin; he was grandfather to one of the rebels and grand-uncle to
another; with many other things. But these were enough.</p>

<p>'Surely, surely, friend,' said Sir Christopher, 'thou wilt not
take wife and daughter? They cannot help the Cause; they have
no place in a camp!'</p>

<p>'Young men and maidens: one with another. Quick! we
waste the time.'</p>

<p>'And to ride all night? Consider, man&mdash;all night long!'</p>

<p>'What is a night? They will have all eternity for rest.'</p>

<p>'He hath set his heart upon it,' said my mother. 'Let us go&mdash;a
night's weariness will not do much harm. Let us go, Sir
Christopher, without further parley.'</p>

<p>'Go then, in the Name of God,' said the old man. 'Child, give
me a kiss.' He took me in his arms and kissed me on the forehead.
'Thou art, then,' he said tenderly, 'devoted to the Protestant
Cause. Why, thou art already promised to a Protestant
since this morning: forget not that promise, child. Humphrey
and Barnaby will protect thee&mdash;and'&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>'Sir,' cried Robin quickly, 'by your leave, I alone have the
right to go with her and to protect her.'</p>

<p>'Nay, Robin,' I said, 'stay here until Sir Christopher himself
bids thee go. That will perhaps be very soon. Remember thy
promise. We did not know, Robin, an hour ago, that the promise
would be claimed so soon. Robin'&mdash;for he murmured&mdash;'I charge
thee, remain at home until'&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>'I promise thee, Sweetheart.' But he hung his head and
looked ashamed.</p>

<p>Sir Christopher, holding my hand, stepped forth upon the grass
and looked upwards into the clear sky, where in the transparent
twilight we could see a few stars twinkling.</p>

<p>'This, friend Eykin&mdash;this, Humphrey,' he said, gravely, 'is a
solemn night for all. No more fateful night hath ever fallen upon
any of us; no! not that day when I joined Hampden's new regiment
and followed with the army of Lord Essex. Granted that we
have a righteous cause, we know not that our leader hath in him
the root of the matter. To rise against the King is a most weighty
matter&mdash;fatal if it fail, a dangerous precedent if it succeed. Civil
war is, of all wars, the most grievous; to fight under a leader who
doth not live after the Laws of God is, methinks, most dangerous.
The Duke hath lit a torch which will spread flames everywhere'&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>'It is the Voice of the Lord which calleth us!' my father interrupted.
'To-morrow I shall speak again to God's Elect.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span></p>

<p>'Sir,' said Humphrey, very seriously, 'I pray you think not
that this enterprise hath been rashly entered upon, nor that we
depend upon the judgment of the Duke alone. It is, most unhappily,
true that his life is sinful, and so is that of Lord Grey, who
hath deserted his own lawful wife for her sister. But those who
have pushed on the enterprise consider that the Duke is, at least, a
true Protestant. They have, moreover, received solid assurances
of support from every quarter. You have been kept in the dark
from the beginning at my own earnest request, because, though I
knew full well your opinion, I would not trouble your peace or endanger
your person. Suffer us, then, to depart, and, for yourself,
do nothing; and keep&mdash;oh! Sir, I entreat you&mdash;keep Robin at
home until our success leaves no room for doubt.'</p>

<p>'Go, then, go,' said Sir Christopher; 'I have grievous misgivings
that all is not well. But go, and Heaven bless the Cause!'</p>

<p>Robin kissed me, whispering that he would follow, and that
before many days; and so we mounted and rode forth. In such
hot haste did we depart that we took with us no change of raiment
or any provision for the journey at all, save that Barnaby, who, as
I afterwards found, never forgot the provisions, found time to get
together a small parcel of bread and meat, and a flask of Canary,
with which to refresh our spirits later on. We even rode away
without any money.</p>

<p>My father rode one horse and my mother sat behind him: then
I followed, Barnaby marching manfully beside me, and Humphrey
rode last. The ways are rough, so that those who ride, even by
daylight, go but slowly; and we, riding between high hedges, went
much too slowly for my father, who, if he spoke at all, cried out
impatiently, 'Quicker! Quicker! we lose the time.'</p>

<p>He sat bending over the horse's head, with rounded shoulders,
his feet sticking out on either side, his long white hair and his
ragged cassock floating in the wind. In his left hand he carried
his Bible as a soldier carries his sword; on his head he wore the
black silk cap in which he daily sat at work. He was praying and
meditating; he was preparing the sermon which he would deliver
in the morning.</p>

<p>Barnaby plodded on beside me: night or day made no difference
to him. He slept when he could, and worked when he must.
Sailors keep their watch day and night without any difference.</p>

<p>'It was Sir Christopher that I came after,' he told me presently.
'Mr. Dare&mdash;who hath since been killed by Mr. Fletcher&mdash;told the
Duke that if Sir Christopher Challis would only come into camp,
old as he is, the country gentlemen of his opinions would follow to
a man, so respected is he. Well, he will not. But we have his
grandnephew, Humphrey; and, if I mistake not, we shall have his
grandson&mdash;if kisses mean anything. So Robin is thy Sweetheart,
Sister: thou art a lucky girl. And we shall have Dad to preach to
us. Well, I know not what will happen, but some will be knocked
o' the head, and if Dad goes in the way of knocks&mdash;&mdash;But, whatever<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
happens, he will get his tongue again&mdash;and so he will be
happy.'</p>

<p>'As for preaching,' he went on, speaking with due pauses, because
there was no hurry in these dark lanes, and he was never one
of those whose words flow easily, 'if he thinks to preach daily, as
they say was done in Cromwell's time, I doubt if he will find many
to listen, for by the look of the fellows who are crowding into camp
they will love the clinking of the can better than the division of the
text. But if he cause his friends to join he will be welcomed: and
for devoting his wife and daughter to the Cause, that, Sister, with
submission, is rank nonsense, and the sooner you get out of the
camp, if you must go there, the better. Women aboard ship are
bad enough, but in camp they are the very devil.'</p>

<p>'Barnaby, speak not lightly of the Evil One.'</p>

<p>'Where shall we bestow you when the fighting comes? Well,
it shall be in some safe place.'</p>

<p>'Oh, Barnaby! will there be fighting?'</p>

<p>'Good lack, child! what else will there be?'</p>

<p>'As the walls of Jericho fell down at the blast of the trumpet,
so the King's armies will be dispersed at the approach of the Lord's
soldiers.'</p>

<p>'That was a vast long time ago, Sister. There is now no such
trumpet-work employed in war, and no priests on the march; but
plenty of fighting to be done before anything is accomplished. But
have no fear. The country is rising. They are sick at heart
already of a Popish King. I say not that it will be easy work; but
it can be done, and it will be done, before we all sit down again.'</p>

<p>'And what will happen when it is done?'</p>

<p>'Truly, I know not. When one King is sent a-packing they
must needs put up another, I suppose. My father shall have the
biggest church in the country to preach in; Humphrey shall be
made physician to the new King&mdash;nothing less; you shall marry
Robin, and he shall be made a Duke or a Lord at least; and I
shall have command of the biggest ship in the King's navy, and go
to fight the Spaniards, or to trade for negroes on the Guinea
Coast.'</p>

<p>'But suppose the Duke should be defeated?'</p>

<p>'Well, Sister, if he is defeated it will go hard with all of us.
Those who are caught will be stabbed with a Bridport dagger, as
they say. Ask not such a question; as well ask a sailor what will
happen to him if his ship is cast away. Some may escape in boats
and some by swimming, and some are drowned, and some are cast
upon savage shores. Every man must take his chance. Never
again ask such a question. Nevertheless, I fear my father will get
his neck as far in the noose as I myself. But remember, Sister
Alice, do you and my mother keep snug. Let others carry on the
rebellion, do you keep snug. For, d'ye see, a man takes his chance,
and if there should happen (as there may) a defeat and the rout of
these country lads, I could e'en scud by myself before the gale and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
maybe get to a seaport and so aboard and away while the chase was
hot. But for a woman! Keep snug, I say, therefore.'</p>

<p>The night, happily, was clear and fine. A slight breeze was
blowing from the north-west, which made one shiver, yet it was
not too cold. I heard the screech-owl once or twice, which caused
me to tremble more than the cold. The road, when we left the
highway, which is not often mended in these parts, became a
narrow lane full of holes and deep ruts, or else a track across open
country. But Barnaby knew the way.</p>

<p>It was about ten of the clock when we began our journey, and
it was six in the morning when we finished it. I suppose there are
few women who can boast of having taken so long a ride and in
the night. Yet, strange to say, I felt no desire to sleep; nor was I
wearied with the jogging of the horse, but was sustained by something
of the spirit of my father. A wonderful thing it seemed to
me that a simple country maid, such as myself, should help in
putting down the Catholic King; women there have been who have
played great parts in history&mdash;Jael, Deborah, Judith, and Esther,
for example; but that I should be called (since then I have discovered
that I was not called), this, indeed, seemed truly wonderful.
Then I was going forth to witness the array of a gallant army
about to fight for freedom and for religion, just as they were
arrayed forty years before, when Sir Christopher was a young man
and rode among them.</p>

<p>My brother, this stout Barnaby, was one of them; my father
was one of them; Humphrey was one of them; and in a little
while I was very sure (because Robin would feel no peace of mind
if I was with the insurgents and he was still at home) my lover
would be with them too. And I pictured to myself a holy and
serious camp, filled with godly, sober soldiers, listening to sermons
and reading the Bible, going forth to battle with hymns upon their
lips; and withal so valiant that at their very first onset the battalions
of the King would be shattered. Alas! anyone may guess the foolish
thoughts of a girl who had no knowledge of the world, nor any
experience. Yet all my life I had been taught that Resistance
was at times a sacred duty, and that the Divine Right of the (so-called)
Lord's Anointed was a vain superstition. So far, therefore,
was I better prepared than most women for the work in hand.</p>

<p>When we rode through Sherborne all the folk were a-bed and
the streets were empty. From Sherborne our way lay through
Yetminster and Evershott to Beaminster, where we watered and
rested the horses, and took some of Barnaby's provisions. The
country through which we rode was full of memories of the last
great war. The castle of Sherborne was twice besieged; once by
Lord Bedford, when the Marquis of Hertford held it for the King.
That siege was raised; but it was afterwards taken by Fairfax, with
its garrison of six hundred soldiers, and was then destroyed, so
that it is now a heap of ruins; and as for Beaminster, the town
hath never recovered from the great fire when Prince Maurice held<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
it, and it is still half in ruins, though the ivy hath grown over the
blackened walls of the burned houses. The last great war, of
which I had heard so much! And now, perhaps, we were about to
begin another.</p>

<p>It was two o'clock in the morning when we dismounted at
Beaminster. My mother sat down upon a bench and fell instantly
asleep. My father walked up and down impatiently, as grudging
every minute. Barnaby, for his part, made a leisurely and comfortable
meal, eating his bread and meat&mdash;of which I had some&mdash;and
drinking his Canary with relish, as if we were on a journey of
pleasure and there was plenty of time for leisurely feeding.
Presently he arose with a sigh (the food and wine being all gone),
and said that, the horses being now rested, we might proceed. So
he lifted my mother into her seat and we went on with the journey,
the day now breaking.</p>

<p>The way, I say, was never tedious to me, for I was sustained
by the novelty and the strangeness of the thing. Although I had
a thousand things to ask Barnaby, it must be confessed that for
one who had travelled so far he had marvellous little to tell. I
daresay that the deck and cabins of a ship are much the same
whether she be on the Spanish Main or in the Bristol Channel,
and sailors, even in port, are never an observant race, except of
weather and so forth. It was strange, however, only to look upon
him and to mark how stout a man he was grown and how strong,
and yet how he still spoke like the old Barnaby, so good-natured
and so dull with his book, who was daily flogged for his Latin
grammar, and bore no malice, but prepared himself to enjoy the
present when the flogging was over, and not to anticipate the certain
repetition of the flogging on the morrow. He spoke in the
same slow way, as if speech were a thing too precious to be poured
out quickly; and there was always sense in what he said (Barnaby
was only stupid in the matter of syntax), though he gave me not
such answers as I could have wished. However, he confessed,
little by little, something of his history and adventures. When
he ran away, it was, as we thought, to the port of Bristol, where
he presently found a berth as cabin-boy on board a West India-man.
In this truly enviable post&mdash;everybody on board has a cuff
or a kick or a rope's-end for the boy&mdash;he continued for some time.
'But,' said Barnaby, 'you are not to think that the rope's-end was
half so bad as my father's rod; nor the captain's oath so bad as
my father's rebuke; nor the rough work and hard fare so bad as
the Latin syntax.' Being so strong, and a hearty, willing lad to
boot, he was quickly promoted to be an able seaman, when there
were no more rope's-endings for him. Then, having an ambition
above his station, and not liking his rude and ignorant companions
of the fo'k'sle (which is the fore-part of a ship, where the common
sailors sleep and eat), and being so fortunate as to win the good
graces of the supercargo first and of the captain next, he applied
his leisure time (when he had any leisure) to the method of taking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
observations, of calculating longitudes and latitudes, his knowledge
of arithmetic having fortunately stuck in his mind longer
than that of Latin. These things, I understand, are of the greatest
use to a sailor and necessary to an officer. Armed with this knowledge,
and the recommendation of his superiors, Barnaby was promoted
from before the mast and became what they call a mate,
and so rose by degrees until he was at last second captain. But
by this time he had made many voyages to the West Indies, to New
York and Baltimore, and to the West Coast of Africa in the service
of his owners, and, I daresay, had procured much wealth for them,
though but little for himself. And, being at Rotterdam upon his
owners' business, he was easily persuaded&mdash;being always a stout
Protestant, and desirous to strike a blow in revenge for the ejection
of his father&mdash;to engage as sailing Master on board the frigate
which brought over the Duke of Monmouth and his company, and
then to join him on his landing. This was the sum of what he had
to tell me. He had seen many strange people, wonderful things,
and monsters of the deep: Indians, whom the cruelty and avarice
of the Spaniards have well-nigh destroyed, the sugar plantations in
the islands, negro slaves, negroes free in their own country,
sharks and calamaries (of which I had read and heard)&mdash;he had
seen all these things, and still remained (in his mind, I mean) as
if he had seen nothing. So wonderfully made are some men that,
whatever they see, they are in no way moved.</p>

<p>I say, then, that Barnaby answered my questions, as we rode
along, briefly, and as if such matters troubled him not. When I
asked him, for example, how the poor miserable slaves liked being
captured and sold and put on board ship crowded together for so
long a voyage, Barnaby replied that he did not know, his business
being to buy them and carry them across the water, and if they
rebelled on board ship to shoot them down or flog them; and when
they got to Jamaica to sell them: where, if they would not work,
they would be flogged until they came to a better mind. If a
man was born a negro, what else, he asked, could he expect?</p>

<p>There was one question which I greatly desired to ask him, but
dared not. It concerned the welfare of his soul. Presently, however,
Barnaby answered that question, before I put it.</p>

<p>'Sister,' he said, 'my mother's constant affliction concerning
me, before I ran away, was as to the salvation of my soul. And
truly, that formerly seemed to me so difficult a thing to compass
(like navigation to an unknown port over an unknown sea set
everywhere with hidden rocks and liable to sudden gusts) that I
could not understand how a plain man could ever succeed in it.
Wherefore it comforted me mightily after I got to sea to learn on
good authority that there is another way, which, compared with
my father's, is light and easy. In short, Sister, though he knows
it not, there is one religion for lands-folk and another for sailor-folk.
A sailor (everybody knows) cannot get so much as a sail
bent without cursing and swearing&mdash;this, which is desperately<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
wicked ashore, counts for nothing at all afloat: and so with many
other things; and the long and the short of it is that if a sailor
does his duty, fights his ship like a man, is true to his owners and
faithful to his messmates, it matters not one straw whether he
hath daily sworn great oaths, drunk himself (whenever he went
ashore) as helpless as a log, and kissed a pretty girl whenever his
good luck gave him the chance&mdash;which does, indeed, seldom come
to most sailors'&mdash;he added this with a deep sigh&mdash;'I say, Sister,
that for such a sailor, when his ship goes down with him, or when
he gets a grapeshot through his vitals, or when he dies of fever,
as happens often enough in the hot climates, there is no question
as to the safety of his soul, but he goes straight to heaven. What
he is ordered to do when he gets there,' said Barnaby, 'I cannot
say; but it will be something, I doubt not, that a sailor will like
to do. No catechism or Latin syntax. Wherefore, Sister, you can
set my mother's heart&mdash;poor soul!&mdash;quite at rest on this important
matter. You can tell her that you have conversed with me, and
that I have that very same inward assurance of which my father
speaks so much and at such length. The very same assurance it
is&mdash;tell her that. And beg her to ask me no questions upon the
matter.'</p>

<p>'Well, Barnaby; but art thou sure'&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>'It is a heavenly comfort,' he replied, before I had time to
finish, 'to have such an assurance. For why? A man that hath
it doth never more trouble himself about what shall happen to him
after he is dead. Therefore he goes about his duty with an easy
mind; and so, Sister, no more upon this head, if you love me and
desire peace of mind for my mother.'</p>

<p>So nothing more was said upon that subject then or afterwards.
A sailor to be exempted by right of his calling from the religion of
the landsman! 'Tis a strange and dangerous doctrine. But, if all
sailors believe it, yet how can it be? This question, I confess, is
too high for me. And as for my mother, I gave her Barnaby's
message, begging her at the same time not to question him further.
And she sighed, but obeyed.</p>

<p>Presently Barnaby asked me if we had any money.</p>

<p>I had none, and I knew that my mother could have but little.
Of course, my father never had any. I doubt if he had possessed
a single penny since his ejection.</p>

<p>'Well,' said Barnaby, 'I thought to give my money to mother.
But I now perceive that if she has it she will give it to Dad;
and, if he has it, he will give it all to the Duke for the Cause&mdash;wherefore,
Sister, do you take it and keep it, not for me, but to be
expended as seemeth you best.' He lugged out of his pocket a
heavy bag. 'Here is all the money I have saved in ten years.
Nay&mdash;I am not as some sailors, one that cannot keep a penny in
purse, but must needs fling all away. Here are two hundred and
fifty gold pieces. Take them, Alice. Hang the bag round thy
neck, and never part with it, day or night. And say nothing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
about the money either to mother or to Dad, for he will assuredly
do with it as I have said. A time may come when thou wilt
want it.'</p>

<p>Two hundred and fifty gold pieces! Was it possible that
Barnaby could be so rich? I took the bag and hung it round my
waist&mdash;not my neck&mdash;by the string which he had tied above the
neck, and, as it was covered by my mantle, nobody ever suspected
that I had this treasure. In the end, as you shall hear, it seemed
to be useful.</p>

<p>It was now broad daylight, and the sun was up. As we drew
near Bridport there stood a man in the road armed with a halbert.</p>

<p>'Whither go ye, good people?' he asked. 'What is your
business?'</p>

<p>'Friend,' said Barnaby, flourishing his oaken staff, 'we ride
upon our own business. Stand aside, or thou mayest henceforth
have no more business to do upon this earth!'</p>

<p>'Ride on then&mdash;ride on,' he replied, standing aside with great
meekness. This was one of the guards whom they posted everywhere
upon the roads in order to stop the people who were flocking
to the camp. In this way many were sent back, and many were
arrested on their way to join Monmouth.</p>

<p>Now, as we drew near to Bridport, the time being about four
o'clock, we heard the firing of guns and a great shouting.</p>

<p>'They have begun the fighting,' said Barnaby. 'I knew it
would not be long a-coming.'</p>

<p>It was, in fact, the first engagement, when the Dorsetshire
Militia were driven out of Bridport by the Duke's troops, and
there would have been a signal victory at the very outset but for
the cowardice of Lord Grey, who ran away with the Horse.</p>

<p>Well, it was a strange and a wonderful thing to think that close
at hand were men killing each other on the Sabbath; yea, and
some lying wounded on the roads; and that civil war had again
begun.</p>

<p>'Let us push on,' said Humphrey, 'out of the way of these
troops. They are but country lads all of them. If they retreat,
they will run; and if they run they will be seized with a panic,
and will run all the way back to Lyme, trampling on everything
that is in the road.'</p>

<p>This was sound advice, which we followed, taking an upper track
which brought us into the high road a mile or so nearer Charmouth.</p>

<p>I do not think there can be anywhere a finer road than that
which runs from Charmouth to Lyme. It runneth over high hills,
sometimes above the sea, which rolls far below, and sometimes
above a great level inland plain, the name of which I have forgotten.
The highest of the hills is called Golden Cap; the reason why was
plainly shown this morning when the sky was clear and the sun
was shining from the south-east full upon this tall pico. When we
got into this road we found it full of young fellows, lusty and well-conditioned,
all marching, running, walking, shouting, and singing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
on their way to join Monmouth. Some were adorned with flowers,
some wore the blue favour of the Duke, some had cockades in their
hats, and some again were armed with musket or with sword; some
carried pikes, some knives tied on to long poles, some had nothing
but thick cudgels, which they brandished valiantly. At sight of
these brave fellows my father lifted his head and waved his
hand, crying 'A Monmouth! a Monmouth! Follow me, brave
lads!' just as if he had been a captain encouraging his men to
charge.</p>

<p>The church of Lyme standeth high upon the cliff which faces
the sea; it is on the eastern side of the town, and before you get
to the church, on the way from Charmouth, there is a broad field
also on the edge of the cliff. It was this field that was the first
camp of Monmouth's men. There were no tents for the men to
lie in, but there were waggons filled, I suppose, with munitions of
war; there were booths where things were sold, such as hot
sausages fried over a charcoal fire, fried fish, lobsters and periwinkles,
cold bacon and pork, bread, cheese, and such like, and
barrels of beer and cider on wooden trestles. The men were
haggling for the food and drink, and already one or two seemed
fuddled. Some were exercising in the use of arms; some were
dancing, and some singing. And no thought or respect paid at all
to the Sabbath. Oh! was this the pious and godly camp which I
had expected?</p>

<p>'Sister,' said Barnaby, 'this is a godly and religious place to
which the wisdom of Dad hath brought thee. Perhaps he meaneth
thee to lie in the open like the lads.'</p>

<p>'Where is the Duke?' asked my father, looking wrathfully at
these revellers and Sabbath-breakers.</p>

<p>'The Duke lies at the George Inn,' said Barnaby. 'I will
show the way.'</p>

<p>In the blue parlour of the George the Duke was at that time
holding a council. There were different reports as to the Bridport
affair. Already it was said that Lord Grey was unfit to lead the
Horse, having been the first to run away; and some said that the
Militia were driven out of the town in a panic, and some that
they made a stand, and that our men had fled. I know not what
was the truth, and now it matters little, except that the first
action of our men brought them little honour. When the council
was finished, the Duke sent word that he would receive Dr. Challis
(that was Humphrey) and Dr. Comfort Eykin.</p>

<p>So they were introduced to the presence of his Grace, and first
my father&mdash;as Humphrey told me&mdash;fell into a kind of ecstasy,
praising God for the landing of the Duke, and foretelling such
speedy victory as would lay the enemies of the country at his
feet. He then drew forth a roll of paper in which he had set
down, for the information of the Duke, the estimated number of
the disaffected in every town of the south and west of England,
with the names of such as could be trusted not only to risk their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
own bodies and estates in the Cause, but would stir up and
encourage their friends. There were so many on these lists that
the Duke's eyes brightened as he read them.</p>

<p>'Sir,' he said, 'if these reports can be depended upon, we are
indeed made men. What is your opinion, Dr. Challis?'</p>

<p>'My opinion, Sir, is that these are the names of friends and
well-wishers; if they see your Grace well supported at the outset
they will flock in; if not, many of them will stand aloof.'</p>

<p>'Will Sir Christopher join me?' asked the Duke.</p>

<p>'No, Sir; he is now seventy-five years of age.'</p>

<p>The Duke turned away. Presently he returned to the lists and
asked many more questions.</p>

<p>'Sir,' said my father, at length, 'I have given you the names
of all that I know who are well affected to the Protestant Cause;
they are those who have remained faithful to the ejected Ministers.
Many a time have I secretly preached to them. One thing is
wanting: the assurance that your Grace will bestow upon us
liberty of conscience and freedom of worship. Else will not one
of them move hand or foot.'</p>

<p>'Why,' said the Duke, 'for what other purpose am I come?
Assure them, good friend, assure them in my name; make the
most solemn pledge that is in your power and in mine.'</p>

<p>'In that case, Sir,' said my father, 'I will at once write letters
with my own hand to the brethren everywhere. There are many
honest country lads who will carry the letters by ways where they
are not likely to be arrested and searched. And now, Sir, I pray
your leave to preach to these your soldiers. They are at present
drinking, swearing, and breaking the Sabbath. The campaign
which should be begun with prayer and humiliation for the
sins of the country hath been begun with many deadly sins, with
merriment, and with fooling. Suffer me, then, to preach to
them.'</p>

<p>'Preach, by all means,' said the Duke. 'You shall have the
parish church. I fear, Sir, that my business will not suffer me to
have the edification of your sermon, but I hope that it will tend to
the soberness and earnestness of my men. Forgive them, Sir, for
their lightness of heart. They are for the most part young.
Encourage them by promises rather than by rebuke. And so, Sir,
for this occasion, farewell!'</p>

<p>In this way my father obtained the wish of his heart, and
preached once more in a church before the people who were the
young soldiers of Monmouth's army.</p>

<p>I did not hear that sermon, because I was asleep. It was in
tones of thunder that my father preached to them. He spoke of
the old war, and the brave deeds that their fathers had done under
Cromwell; theirs was the victory. Now, as then, the victory
should be theirs, if they carried the spirit of faithfulness into
battle. He warned them of their sins, sparing none; and, in the
end, he concluded with such a denunciation of the King as made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
all who heard it, and had been taught to regard the King's Majesty
as sacred, open their mouths and gape upon each other; for then,
for the first time, they truly understood what it was that they were
engaged to do.</p>

<p>While my father waited to see the Duke, Barnaby went
about looking for a lodging. The town is small, and the houses
were all filled, but he presently found a cottage (call it rather a hut)
on the shore beside the Cobb, where, on promise of an extravagant
payment, the fisherman's wife consented to give up her bed to my
mother and myself. Before the bargain was concluded, I had laid
myself down upon it and was sound asleep.</p>

<p>So I slept the whole day; though outside there was such a
trampling on the beach, such a landing of stores and creaking of
chains, as might have awakened the Seven Sleepers. But me
nothing could awaken.</p>

<p>In the evening I woke up refreshed. My mother was already
awake, but for weariness could not move out of her chair. The
good woman of the cottage, a kindly soul, brought me rough food
of some kind with a drink of water&mdash;the army had drunk up all the
milk, eaten all the cheese, the butter, the eggs, and the pork, beef
and mutton, in the place. And then Humphrey came and asked if
I would go with him into the town to see the soldiers. So I went,
and glad I was to see the sight. But Lord! to think that it was the
Sabbath evening! For the main street of Lyme was full of men,
swaggering with long swords at their sides and some with spurs&mdash;feathers
in their hats, and pistols stuck in their belts&mdash;all were talking
loud, as I am told is the custom in a camp of soldiers. Outside
the George there was a barrel on a stand, and vendors and
drawers ran about with cans, fetching and carrying the liquor for
which the men continually called. Then at the door of the George
there appeared the Duke himself with his following of gentlemen.
All rose and huzzaed while the Duke came down the steps and
turned towards the camp outside the town.</p>

<p>I saw his face very well as he passed. Indeed, I saw him many
times afterwards, but I declare that my heart sank when first I
gazed upon him as he stood upon the steps of the George Inn. For
on his face, plain to read, was the sadness of coming ruin. I say
I knew from that moment what would be his end. Nay, I am no
prophetess, nor am I a witch to know beforehand the counsels of
the Almighty; yet the Lord hath permitted by certain signs the
future to become apparent to those who know how to read them.
In the Duke of Monmouth the signs were a restless and uneasy
eye, an air of preoccupation, a trembling mouth and a hesitating
manner. There was in him nothing of the confidence of one who
knows that fortune is about to smile upon him. This, I say,
was my first thought about the Duke, and the first thought is
prophecy.</p>

<p>There sat beside the benches a secretary, or clerk, who took down
the names of recruits. The Duke stopped and looked on. A young<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
man, in a sober suit of brown, in appearance different from the
country lads, was giving in his name.</p>

<p>'Daniel Foe, your Grace,' said the clerk, looking up. 'He is
from London.'</p>

<p>'From London,' the Duke repeated. 'I have many friends in
London. I expect them shortly. Thou art a worthy lad and
deservest encouragement.' So he passed on his way.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVI.</h2>

<h3>ON THE MARCH.</h3>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 268px;">
<img src="images/i_122.jpg" width="268" height="350" alt="daybreak" />
</div>

<p>At daybreak, next morning, the
drums began to beat, and
the trumpets began to blow,
and, after breakfast, the
newly-raised army marched
out in such order as was
possible. I have not to
write a history of this rebellion,
which hath already
been done by able hands;
I speak only of what I saw,
and the things with which
I was concerned.</p>

<p>First, then, it is true that the whole
country was swiftly put into a ferment by
the Duke's landing; and, had those who
planned the expedition provided a proper
supply of arms, the army would have quickly
mustered 20,000 men, all resolute and capable
of meeting any force that the King could have
raised. Nay, it would have grown and swelled as it
moved. But there were never enough arms from the
outset. Everything at first promised well for the
Duke. But there were not arms for the half of those who came
in. The spirit of the Devon and Somerset Militia was lukewarm;
they ran at Bridport, at Axminster, and at Chard; nay, some of
them even deserted to join the Duke. There were thousands scattered
about the country&mdash;those, namely, who still held to the
doctrines of the persecuted ministers, and those who abhorred the
Catholic religion&mdash;who wished well and would have joined&mdash;Humphrey
knew well-wishers by the thousand whose names were
on the lists in Holland&mdash;but how could they join when the army
was so ill-found? And this was the principal reason, I have been
assured, why the country gentlemen, with their following, did not
come in at first&mdash;because there were no arms. How can soldiers
fight when they have no arms? How could the Duke have been
suffered to begin with so scanty a preparation of arms? Afterwards,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
when Monmouth proclaimed himself King, there were, perhaps,
other reasons why the well-wishers held aloof. Some of them
certainly, who were known to be friends of the Duke (among them
our old friend Mr. Prideaux, of Ford Abbey), were arrested and
thrown into prison, while many thousands who were flocking to
the standard were either turned back upon the road or seized and
thrown into prison.</p>

<p>As for the quality of the troops which formed the army, I know
nothing, except that at Sedgemoor they continued to fight valiantly
after their leaders had fled. They were raw troops&mdash;mere country
lads&mdash;and their officers were, for the most part, simple tradesmen
who had no knowledge of the art of war. Dare the younger was a
goldsmith; Captain Perrot was a dyer; Captain Hucker, a maker
of serge; and so on with all of them. It was unfortunate that Mr.
Andrew Fletcher, of Saltoun, should have killed Mr. Dare the elder
on the first day, because, as everybody agrees, the former was the
most experienced soldier in the whole army.</p>

<p>The route proposed by the Duke was known to everybody. He
intended to march through Taunton, Bridgwater, and Bristol to
Gloucester, where he thought he would be joined by a new army
raised by his friends in Cheshire. He also reckoned on receiving
adherents everywhere on the road, and on easily defeating any force
that the King should be able to send against him. How he fared
in that notable scheme is common history.</p>

<p>Long before the army was ready to march, Humphrey came to
advise with us. First of all, he endeavoured to have speech with
my father, but in vain (henceforth my father seemed to have no
thought of his wife and daughter). Humphrey, therefore, advised
us to go home. 'As for your alleged dedication to the Cause,' he
said, 'I think that he hath already forgotten it, seeing that it means
nothing, and that your presence with us cannot help. Go home,
then, Madam, and let Alice persuade Robin to stay at home in
order to take care of you.'</p>

<p>'Nay,' said my mother; 'that may we not do. I must obey
my husband, who commanded us to follow him. Whither he
goeth thither also I will follow.'</p>

<p>Finding that she was resolute upon this point, Humphrey told
us that the Duke would certainly march upon Taunton, where more
than half of the town were his friends. He therefore advised that
we should ride to that place&mdash;not following the army, but going
across the country, most of which is a very wild and desolate part,
where we should be in no danger except from gipsies and such wild
people, robbers and rogues, truly, but now making the most of the
disturbed state of the country, and running about the roads plundering
and thieving. But he said he would himself provide us with a
guide, one who knew the way, and a good stout fellow, armed with
a cudgel, at least. To this my mother agreed, fearing to anger her
husband if she should disturb him at his work.</p>

<p>Humphrey had little trouble in finding the guide for us. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
was an honest lad from a place called Holford, in the Quantock
Hills, who, finding that there were no arms for him, was going home
again. Unhappily, when we got to Taunton, he was persuaded&mdash;partly
by me, alas!&mdash;to remain. He joined Barnaby's company,
and was either killed at Sedgemoor, or was one of those hanged at
Weston Zoyland, or Bridgwater. For he was no more heard of.</p>

<p>This business settled, we went up to the churchyard in order to
see the march of the army out of camp. And a brave show the
gallant soldiers made.</p>

<p>First rode Colonel Wade with the vanguard. After them, with
a due interval, rode the greater part of the Horse, already three
hundred strong, under Lord Grey, of Wark. Among them was the
company sent by Mr. Speke, of White Lackington, forty very stout
fellows, well armed, and mounted on cart-horses. The main army
was composed of four regiments. The first was the Blue Regiment,
or the Duke's Own, whose Colonel was the aforesaid Wade. They
formed the van, and were seven hundred strong. The others were
the White, commanded by Colonel Foukes; the Green, by Colonel
Holmes; and the Yellow, by Colonel Fox. All these regiments
were fully armed, the men wearing favours or rosettes in their hats
and on their arms of the colour from which their regiment was
named.</p>

<p>The Duke himself, who rode a great white horse, was surrounded
by a small bodyguard of gentlemen (afterwards they became a company
of forty), richly dressed and well mounted. With him were
carried the colours, embroidered with the words 'Pro Religione et
Libertate.' This was the second time that I had seen the Duke,
and again I felt at sight of his face the foreknowledge of coming
woe. On such an occasion the chief should show a gallant mien
and a face of cheerful hope. The Duke, however, looked gloomy,
and hung his head.</p>

<p>Truly, it seemed to me as if no force could dare so much as to
meet this great and invincible army. And certainly there could
nowhere be gathered together a more stalwart set of soldiers, nearly
all young men, and full of spirit. They shouted and sang as they
marched. Presently there passed us my brother Barnaby, with his
company of the Green Regiment. It was easy to perceive by the
handling of his arms, and by his bearing, that he was accustomed
to act with others, and already he had so begun to instruct his men
that they set an example to the rest both in their orderliness of
march and the carriage of their weapons.</p>

<p>After the main army they carried the ordnance&mdash;four small
cannon&mdash;and the ammunition in waggons, with guards and horsemen.
Lastly, there rode those who do not fight, yet belong to the
army. These were the Chaplain to the army, Dr. Hooke, a grave
clergyman of the Church of England; Mr. Ferguson, the Duke's
private Chaplain, a fiery person, of whom many hard things have
been said, which here concern us not; and my father, who thus
rode openly with the other two, in order that the Nonconformists<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
might be encouraged by his presence, as an equal with the two
chaplains. He was clad in a new cassock, obtained I know not
whence. He sat upright in the saddle, a Bible in his hand, his
long white locks lying on his shoulders like a perruque, but more
venerable than any wig. His thin face was flushed with the joy of
coming victory, and his eyes flashed fire. If all the men had shown
such a spirit, the army would have overrun the whole country.
The four surgeons&mdash;Dr. Temple, Dr. Gaylard, Dr. Oliver, and
Humphrey&mdash;followed, all splendid in black velvet and great periwigs.
Lastly marched the rear-guard; and after the army there
followed such a motley crew as no one can conceive. There were
gipsies, with their black tents and carts, ready to rob and plunder;
there were tinkers who are nothing better than gipsies, and are
even said to speak their language; there were men with casks on
wheels filled with beer or cider; there were carts carrying bread,
cakes, biscuits, and such things as one can buy in a booth or at a
fair; there were women of bold and impudent looks, singing as
they walked; there were, besides, whole troops of country lads,
some of them mere boys, running and strutting along in hopes to
receive arms and to take a place in the regiments.</p>

<p>Presently they were all gone, and Lyme was quit of them. What
became in the end of all the rabble rout which followed the army I
know not. One thing was certain: the godly disposition, the pious
singing of psalms, and the devout exposition of the Word which I
had looked for in the army were not anywhere apparent. Rather
there was evident a tumultuous joy, as of schoolboys out for a
holiday&mdash;certainly no schoolboys could have made more noise or
showed greater happiness in their faces. Among them, however,
there were some men of middle age, whose faces showed a different
temper; but these were rare.</p>

<p>'Lord help them!' said our friendly fisherwoman, who stood
with us. 'There will be hard knocks before those fine fellows go
home again.'</p>

<p>'They fight on the Lord's side,' said my mother; 'therefore
they may be killed, but they will not wholly perish.'</p>

<p>As for the hard knocks, they began without any delay, and on
that very morning. For at Axminster they encountered the Somerset
and Devon Militia, who thought to join their forces, but were speedily
put to flight by the rebels&mdash;a victory which greatly encouraged
them.</p>

<p>It hath been maliciously said, I have heard, that we followed the
army&mdash;as if we were two sutler women&mdash;on foot, I suppose, tramping
in the dust, singing ribald songs like those poor creatures whom
we saw marching out of Lyme. You have heard how we agreed to
follow Humphrey's advice. Well, we left Lyme very early the next
morning (our fisherwoman having now become very friendly and
loth to let us go) and rode out, our guide (poor lad! his death lies
heavy on my soul, yet I meant the best: and, truly, he was on the
side of the Lord) marching beside us armed with a stout bludgeon.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
We kept the main road (which was very quiet at this early hour)
as far as Axminster, where we left it; and, after crossing the river
by a ford or wash, we engaged upon a track, or path, which led
along the banks of a little stream for a mile or two&mdash;as far as the
village of Chardstock. Here we made no halt; but, leaving it
behind, we struck into a most wild and mountainous country full of
old forests and great bare places. It is called the Forest of Neroche,
and is said to shelter numbers of gipsies and vagabonds, and to
have in it some of those wild people who live in the hills and woods
of Somerset, and do no work except to gather the dry broom and
tie it up and sell it, and so live hard and hungry lives, but know
not any master. These are reported to be a harmless people, but
the gipsies are dangerous because they are ready to rob and even
murder. I thought of Barnaby's bag of gold tied about my waist,
and trembled. However, we met with none of them on our
journey, because just then they were all running after Monmouth's
army. There was no path over the hills by the way we took; but
our guide knew the country so well that he needed none, pointing
out all the hills with a kind of pride as if they belonged to him,
and telling us the name of every one; but these I have long since
forgotten. The country, however, I can never forget, because it is
so wild and beautiful. One place I remember. It is a very strange
and wonderful place. The ground here is high, and at one place
it rises to a kind of point or hill, falling away, on all sides but one,
in steep sides, up which a man could climb with difficulty. Round
the hill have been cut deep trenches, no doubt to fortify and
strengthen the place, which is by nature a fortress. And on the
side where the ground is level there are raised very high earth-works
or walls with trenches beyond, most wonderful to consider.
Within this double or triple circle of trenches and earthen walls
there stands a farm-house, solitary among the hills. Here we
found an ancient dame who told us that the place had been a castle
of the Romans: yet it was not like unto the castle at Sherborne,
which Oliver Cromwell slighted after he took the place, blowing it
up with gunpowder: nor was it like the castle at Taunton which I
afterwards saw, for there were no stone walls or towers, or any
appearance of stone work. To be sure, Sherborne Castle was not
built by the Romans. Then this old dame showed us bits of pots
dug up within the walls, and rusty arrow heads and green copper
things, which she said were buckles to fasten their clothes withal.
She gave us a cup of cider while we rested and took here our dinner
of cold bacon and bread which we had brought with us. After
dinner our guide took us to the hill called the Beacon, and showed
us the broad Vale of Taunton, spread out below us like unto a
map, with its farm-houses, fields, orchards, and churches. 'And all
for Monmouth,' he said. Surely there cannot be a richer, more
fertile, or more lovely place in all England than the Vale of
Taunton. When we had rested, and enjoyed this enchanting prospect,
we remounted our nags and descended by a gradual incline<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
into the plain below. Humphrey had provided us with a letter
commendatory. He, who knew the names of all who were well
affected, assured us that the lady to whom the letter was addressed,
Miss Susan Blake by name, was one of the most forward in the Protestant
Cause. She was well known and much respected, and she
kept a school for young gentlewomen, where many children of the
Nonconformist gentry were educated. He instructed us to proceed
directly to her house, and to ask her to procure for us a decent
and safe lodging. He could not have given us a letter to any
better person.</p>

<p>It was late in the afternoon when we rode into Taunton. The
streets were full of people running about, talking now in groups
and now by twos and threes; now shouting and now whispering;
while we rode along the street, a man ran bawling&mdash;</p>

<p>'Great news! great news! Monmouth is upon us with twice
ten thousand men!'</p>

<p>It seems that they had only that day learned of the defeat of
the Militia by the rebels. A company of the Somerset Militia
were in the town, under Colonel Luttrell, in order to keep down
the people.</p>

<p>Taunton is, as everybody knows, a most rich, prosperous, and
populous town. I had never before seen so many houses and so
many people gathered together. Why, if the men of Taunton
declared for the Duke, his cause, one felt sure, was already won.
For there is nowhere, as I could not fail to know, a greater stronghold
of Dissent than this town, except London, and none where
the Nonconformists have more injuries to remember. Only two
years before this their meeting-houses had been broken into, and
their pulpits and pews brought out and burned, and they were
forced, against their conscience, to worship in the parish church.</p>

<p>We easily found Miss Blake's house, and, giving our horses to
the guide, we presented her with our letter. She was a young
woman somewhat below the common stature, quick of speech, her
face and eyes full of vivacity, and about thirty years of age. But
when she had read the letter, and understood who we were, and
whence we came, she first made a deep reverence to my mother
and then she took my hands and kissed me.</p>

<p>'Madam,' she said, 'believe me, my poor house will be
honoured indeed by the presence of the wife and the daughter of
the godly Dr. Comfort Eykin. Pray, pray, go no further. I have
a room that is at your disposal. Go thither, Madam, I beg, and
rest after your journey. The wife of Dr. Comfort Eykin. 'Tis
indeed an honour.' And so with the kindest words she led us
upstairs, and gave us a room with a bed in it, and caused water
for washing to be brought, and presently went out with me to buy
certain things needful for us (who were indeed somewhat rustical
in our dress), in order that we might present the appearance of
gentlewomen&mdash;thanks to Barnaby's heavy purse, I could get them
without troubling my mother's careful mind about the cost. She<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
then gave us supper, and told us all the news. The King, she said,
was horribly afraid, and it was rumoured that the priests had all
been sent away to France; the Taunton people were resolved to
give the Duke a brave reception; all over the country, there was
no doubt, men would rally by thousands; she was in a rapture of
joy and gratitude. Supper over, she took us to her school-room,
and here&mdash;oh! the pretty sight!&mdash;her school-girls were engaged in
working and embroidering flags for the Duke's army.</p>

<p>'I know not,' she said, 'whether his Grace will condescend to
receive them. But it is all we women can do.' Poor wretch! she
afterwards suffered the full penalty for her zeal.</p>

<p>All that evening we heard the noise of men running about the
town, with the clanking of weapons and the commands of officers;
but we knew not what had happened.</p>

<p>Lo! in the morning the glad tidings that the Militia had left
the town. Nor was that all: for at daybreak the people began to
assemble, and, there being none to stay them, broke into the great
church of St. Mary's and took possession of the arms that had been
deposited for safety in the tower. They also opened the prison and
set free a worthy Nonconformist divine, named Vincent. All the
morning the mob ran about the streets, shouting, 'A Monmouth!
A Monmouth!' the magistrates and Royalists not daring so much
as to show their faces, and there was nothing talked of but the
overthrow of the King and the triumph of the Protestant religion.
Nay, there were fiery speakers in the market-place and before the
west porch of the church, who mounted on tubs and exhorted the
people. Grave merchants came forth and shook hands with each
other; and godly ministers who had been in hiding walked forth
boldly. It was truly a great day for Taunton.</p>

<p>The excitement grew greater when Captain Hucker, a well-known
serge-maker of the town, rode in with a troop of Monmouth's
Horse. Captain Hucker had been seized by Colonel Phillips
on the charge of receiving a message from the Duke, but he escaped
and joined the rebels, to his greater loss, as afterwards appeared.
However, he now rode in to tell his fellow townsmen of his own
wonderful and providential escape, and that the Duke would certainly
arrive the next day, and he exhorted them to give him such
a welcome as he had a right to expect at their hands. He also reminded
them that they were the sons of the men who, forty years
before, defended Taunton under Admiral Blake. There was a
great shouting and tossing of caps after Captain Hucker's address,
and no one could do too much for the horsemen with him, so that I
fear these brave fellows were soon fain to lie down and sleep till
the fumes of the strong ale should leave their brains.</p>

</div>

<p>All that day and half the night we sat in Miss Blake's school-room
finishing the flags, in which I was permitted to join. There
were twenty-seven flags in all presented to the army by the
Taunton maids: twelve by Miss Blake, and fifteen by one Mrs.
Musgrave, also a schoolmistress. And now, indeed, seeing that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
the Militia at Axminster had fled almost at the mere aspect of one
man, and that those of Taunton had also fled away secretly by
night, and catching the zeal of our kind entertainer, and considering
the courage and spirit of these good people, I began to
feel confident again, and my heart, which had fallen very low at
the sight of the Duke's hanging head and gloomy looks, rose again,
and all dangers seemed to vanish. And so, in a mere fool's paradise,
I continued happy indeed, until the fatal news of Sedgemoor
fight awoke us all from our fond dreams.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVII.</h2>

<h3>TAUNTON.</h3>


<div class="drop">
<img src="images/i_132.jpg" alt="I" width="100" height="99" class="cap" />
 <p class="cap_1">I never weary in thinking of the gaiety and happiness
of those four days at Taunton among the rebels.
There was no more doubt in any of our hearts: we
were all confident of victory&mdash;and that easy and,
perhaps, bloodless. As was the rejoicing at Taunton,
so it would be in every town of the country. One
only had to look out of window in order to feel assurance of that
victory, so jolly, so happy, so confident looked every face.</p>
</div>

<p>'Why,' said Miss Blake, 'in future ages even we women, who
have only worked the flags, will be envied for our share in the
glorious deliverance. Great writers will speak of us as they speak
of the Roman women.' Then all our eyes sparkled, and the
needles flew faster and the flags grew nearer to completion.</p>

<p>If history should condescend to remember the poor Maids of
Taunton at all, it will be, at best, with pity for the afflictions which
afterwards fell upon them: none, certainly, will envy them; but
we shall be forgotten. Why should we be remembered? Women,
it is certain, have no business with affairs of State, and especially
none with rebellions and civil wars. Our hearts and passions
carry us away. The leaders in the Cause which we have joined
appear to us to be more than human; we cannot restrain ourselves,
we fall down and worship our leaders, especially in the
cause of religion and liberty.</p>

<p>Now behold! On the very morning after we arrived at Taunton
I was abroad in the streets with Miss Blake, looking at the town,
which hath shops full of the most beautiful and precious things,
and wondering at the great concourse of people (for the looms were
all deserted, and the workmen were in the streets filled with a
martial spirit), when I saw riding into the town no other than Robin
himself. Oh! how my heart leapt up to see him! He was most
gallantly dressed in a purple coat, with a crimson sash over his
shoulders to carry his sword; he had pistols in his holsters, and
wore great riding-boots, and with him rode a company of a dozen
young men, mounted on good strong nags: why, they were men of
our own village, and I knew them, every one. They were armed
with muskets and pikes&mdash;I knew where those came from&mdash;and
when they saw me the fellows all began to grin, and to square their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
shoulders so as to look more martial. But Robin leapt from his
horse.</p>

<p>''Tis Alice!' he cried. 'Dear heart! Thou art then safe, so
far? Madam, your servant.' Here he took off his hat to Miss
Blake. 'Lads, ride on to the White Hart and call for what you
want, and take care of the nags. This is a joyful meeting, Sweetheart.'
Here he kissed me. 'The Duke, they say, draws thousands
daily. I thought to find him in Taunton by this time. Why, we
are as good as victorious already. Humphrey, I take it, is with
his Grace. My dear, even had the Cause of Freedom failed to
move me I had been dragged by the silken ropes of Love. Truly,
I could not choose but come. There was the thought of these brave
fellows marching to battle, and I all the time skulking at home,
who had ever been so loud upon their side. And there was the
thought of Humphrey, braving the dangers of the field, tender
though he be, and I, strong and lusty, sitting by the fire, and
sleeping on a feather bed; and always there was the thought of
thee, my dear, among these rude soldiers&mdash;like Milton's lady among
the rabble rout, because well I know that even Christian warriors
(so-called) are not lambs; and, again, there was my grandfather,
who could find no rest, but continually walked to and fro, with
looks that at one time said, "Go, my son," and at others, "Nay,
lest thou receive a hurt"; and the white face of my mother, which
said as plain as eyes could speak: "He ought to go, he ought to
go; and yet he may be killed."'</p>

<p>'Oh, Robin! Pray God there prove to be no more fighting.'</p>

<p>'Well, my dear, if I am not tedious to Madam here'&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>'Oh, Sir!' said Miss Blake, 'it is a joy to hear this talk.' She
told me afterwards that it was also a joy to look upon so gallant a
gentleman, and such a pair of lovers. She, poor creature, had no
sweetheart.</p>

<p>'Then on Monday,' Robin continued, 'the day before yesterday,
I could refrain no longer, but laid the matter before my grandfather.
Sweetheart! there is, I swear, no better man in all the world.'</p>

<p>'Of that I am well assured, Robin.'</p>

<p>'First, he said that if anything befell me he should go down in
sorrow to his grave; yet that, as to his own end, an old man so
near the grave should not be concerned about the manner of his
end, so long as he should keep to honour and duty. Next, that in
his own youth he had himself gone forth willingly to fight in the
cause of Liberty, without counting the risk. Thirdly, that if my
conscience did truly urge me to follow the Duke, I ought to obey
that voice in the name of God. And this with tears in his eyes,
and yet a lively and visible satisfaction that, as he himself had
chosen, so his grandson would choose. "Sir," I said, "that voice
of conscience speaks out very loudly and clearly. I cannot stifle it.
Therefore, by your good leave, I will go." Then he bade me take
the best horse in the stable, and gave me a purse of gold, and so I
made ready.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span></p>

<p>Miss Blake, at this point, said that she was reminded of David.
It was, I suppose, because Robin was so goodly a lad to look upon;
otherwise, David, though an exile, did never endeavour to pull
King Saul from his throne.</p>

<p>'Then,' Robin continued, 'I went to my mother. She wept,
because war hath many dangers and chances; but she would not
say me "Nay." And in the evening when the men came home I
went into the village and asked who would go with me. A dozen
stout fellows&mdash;you know them all, Sweetheart&mdash;stepped forth at
once; another dozen would have come, but their wives prevented
them. And so, mounting them on good cart-horses, I bade farewell
and rode away.'</p>

<p>'Sir,' said Miss Blake, 'you have chosen the better part. You
will be rewarded by so splendid a victory that it will surprise all
the world; and for the rest of your life&mdash;yes, and for generations
afterwards&mdash;you will be ranked among the deliverers of your
country. It is a great privilege, Sir, to take part in the noblest
passage of English history. Oh!' she clasped her hands, 'I am
sorry that I am not a man, only because I would strike a blow in
this sacred Cause. But we are women, and we can but pray&mdash;and
make flags. We cannot die for the Cause.'</p>

<p>The event proved that women can sometimes die for the Cause,
because she herself, if any woman ever did, died for her Cause.</p>

<p>Then Robin left us in order to take steps about his men and
himself. Captain Hucker received them in the name of the Duke.
They joined the cavalry, and Robin was told that he should be made
a Captain. This done, he rode out with the rest to meet the Duke.</p>

<p>Now, when his approach was known, everybody who had a
horse rode forth to meet him, so that there followed him, when he
entered the town, not counting his army, so great a company that
they almost made another army.</p>

<p>As soon as it was reported that the Duke was within a mile
(they had that day marched sixteen miles, from Ilminster) the
church bells were set a-ringing; children came out with baskets of
flowers in readiness to strew them at his feet as he should pass&mdash;there
were roses and lilies and all kinds of summer flowers, so that
his horse had a most delicate carpet to walk upon; the common
people crowded the sides of the streets; the windows were filled
with ladies, who waved their handkerchiefs and called aloud on
Heaven to bless the good Duke, the brave Duke, the sweet and
lovely Duke. If there were any malcontents in the town they kept
snug; it would have cost them dear even to have been seen in the
streets that day. The Duke showed on this occasion a face full of
hope and happiness; indeed, if he had not shown a cheerful countenance
on such a day, he would have been something less, or
something greater, than human. I mean that he would have been
either insensible and blockish not to be moved by such a welcome,
or else he would have been a prophet, as foreseeing what would
follow. He rode bareheaded, carrying his hat in his hand; he was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
dressed in a shining corslet with a blue silk scarf and a purple coat;
his long brown hair hung in curls upon his shoulders; his sweet
lips were parted with a gracious smile; his beautiful brown eyes&mdash;never
had any Prince more lovely eyes&mdash;looked pleased and benignant;
truly there was never made any man more comely than
the Duke of Monmouth. The face of his father, and that of his
uncle, King James, were dark and gloomy, but the Duke's face
was naturally bright and cheerful; King Charles's long nose in him
was softened and reduced to the proportions of manly beauty; in
short, there was no feature that in his father was harsh and unpleasing
but was in him sweet and beautiful. If I had thought him
comely and like a King's son when four years before he made his
Progress, I thought him now ten times as gracious and as beautiful.
He was thinner in the face, which gave his appearance the greater
dignity; he had ever the most gracious smile and the most charming
eyes; and at such a moment as this who could believe the
things which they said about his wife and Lady Wentworth? No&mdash;they
were inventions of his enemies; they must be base lies&mdash;so
noble a Presence could not conceal a guilty heart; he must be as
good and virtuous as he was brave and lovely. Thus we talked,
sitting in the window, and thus we cheered our souls. Even now,
to think how great and good he looked on that day, it is difficult
to believe that he was in some matters so vile. I am not of those
who expect one kind of moral conduct from one man and a different
kind from another; there is but one set of commandments for rich
and poor, for prince and peasant. But the pity of it&mdash;oh! the pity
of it, with such a prince!</p>

<p>Never, in short, did one see such a tumult of joy; it is impossible
to speak otherwise: the people had lost their wits with excess
of joy. Nor did they show their welcome in shouting only, for
all doors were thrown wide open, and supplies and necessaries of
all kinds were sent to the soldiers in the camp outside the town,
so that the country lads declared they had never fared more sumptuously.
There now rode after the Duke several Nonconformist
ministers, beside my father. Thus there was the pious Mr. Larke,
of Lyme: he was an aged Baptist preacher, who thought it no
shame to his profession to gird on a sword and to command a troop
of Horse; and others there were, whose names I forget, who had
come forth to join the deliverer.</p>

<p>Lord Grey rode on one side of him, and Colonel Speke on the
other; Dr. Hooke, the Chaplain, and my father rode behind. My
heart swelled with joy to hear how the people, when they had
shouted themselves hoarse, cried out for my father, because his
presence showed that they would have once more that liberty of
worship for want of which they had so long languished. The
Duke's own Chaplain, Mr. Ferguson, had got a naked sword in his
hand, and was marching on foot, crying out, in a most vainglorious
manner, 'I am Ferguson, the famous Ferguson, that Ferguson for
whose head so many hundred pounds were offered. I am that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
man! I am that man!' He wore a great gown and a silken cassock,
which consorted ill with the sword in his hand, and in the
evening he preached in the great church, while my father preached
in the old meeting-house to a much larger congregation, and, I
venture to think, with a much more edifying discourse.</p>

<p>The army marched through the town in much the same order
as it had marched out of Lyme, and it seemed not much bigger,
but the men marched more orderly, and there was less laughing
and shouting. But the streets were so thronged that the men
could hardly make their way.</p>

<p>In the market-place the Duke halted, while his Declaration
was read aloud. One thing I could not approve. They dragged
forth three of the Justices&mdash;High Churchmen and standing stoutly
for King James&mdash;and forced them to listen, bareheaded, to the
Declaration: a thing which came near afterwards to their destruction.
Yet they looked sour and unwilling, as anyone would
have testified. The Declaration was a long document, and the
reading of it took half an hour at least; but the people cheered
all the time.</p>

<p>After this, they read a Proclamation, warning the soldiers
against taking aught without payment. But Robin laughed, saying
that this was the way with armies, where the General was
always on the side of virtue, yet the soldiers were always yielding
to temptation in the matter of sheep and poultry; that human
nature must not be too much tempted, and that camp rations are
sometimes scanty. But it was a noble Proclamation, and I cannot
but believe that the robberies afterwards complained of were committed
by the tattered crew who followed the camp, rather than
by the brave fellows themselves.</p>

<p>The Duke lay at Captain Hucker's house, over against the
Three Cups Inn. This was a great honour for Mr. Hucker, a plain
serge-maker, and there were many who were envious, thinking that
the Duke should not have gone to the house of so humble a person.
It was also said that for his services Mr. Hucker boasted that he
should expect nothing less than a coronet and the title of Peer,
once the business was safely dispatched. A Peer to be made out
of a Master Serge-maker! But we must charitably refuse to believe
all that is reported, and, indeed (I say it with sorrow of that
most unfortunate lady, Miss Blake), much idle tattle concerning
neighbours was carried on in her house, and I was told that it was
the same in every house of Taunton, so that the women spent all
their time in talking of their neighbours' affairs, and what might
be going on in the houses of their friends. This is a kind of talk
which my father would never permit, as testifying to idle curiosity
and leading to undue importance concerning things which are fleeting
and trivial.</p>

<p>However, the Duke was bestowed in Captain Hucker's best
bed&mdash;of that there was no doubt; and the bells rang and bonfires
blazed, and the people sang and shouted in the streets.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVIII.</h2>

<h3>THE MAIDS OF TAUNTON.</h3>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 251px;">
<img src="images/i_137.jpg" width="251" height="350" alt="the" />
</div>

<p>The next day was made remarkable
in our eyes by
an event which, though
doubtless of less importance
than the enlistment
of a dozen recruits, seemed
to us a very great thing indeed&mdash;namely,
the presentation
to the Duke of
the colours embroidered for him by
Susan Blake's school-girls. I was
myself permitted to walk with the
girls on this occasion, as if I had
been one of them, though a stranger
to the place, and but newly arrived&mdash;such
was the kindness of Susan Blake
and her respect for the name of the
learned and pious Dr. Comfort Eykin.</p>

<p>At nine of the clock the girls who
were to carry the flags began to gather in
the school-room. There were twenty-seven
in all; but twelve only were the
pupils of Miss Blake. The others were the pupils of
Mrs. Musgrave, another school-mistress in the town.
I remember not the names of all the girls, but some of
them I can still write down. One was Katharine Bovet, daughter
of Colonel Bovet: she it was who walked first and named to the
Duke those who followed; there was also Mary Blake, cousin of
Susan, who was afterwards thrown into prison with her cousin,
but presently was pardoned. Miss Hucker, daughter of Captain
Hucker, the Master-Serge-maker who entertained the Duke, was
another; there were three daughters of Captain Herring; two
daughters of Mr. Thomas Baker, one of Monmouth's Privy Councillors;
there was Mary Meade, the girl who carried the famous
Golden Flag; and others whom I have forgotten. When we were
assembled, being dressed all in white, and each maid wearing the
Monmouth colours, we took our flags and sallied forth. In the
street there was almost as great a crowd to look on as the day
before, when the Duke rode in; and, certainly, it was a very pretty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
sight to see. First marched a man playing on the crowd very
briskly; after him, one who beat a tabor, and one who played
a fife; so that we had music on our march. When the music
stopped, we lifted our voices and sang a Psalm all together; that
done the crowder began again.</p>

<p>As for the procession, no one surely had ever seen the like of
it! After the music walked six-and-twenty maids, the youngest
eight and the eldest not more than twelve. They marched two by
two, very orderly, all dressed in white with blue favours, and
every girl carrying in her hands a flag of silk embroidered by herself,
assisted by Miss Blake or some other older person, with
devices appropriate to the nature of the enterprise in hand. For
one flag had upon it, truly figured in scarlet silk, an open Bible,
because it was for liberty to read and expound that book that the
men were going forth to fight. Upon another was embroidered a
great cross; upon a third were the arms of the Duke; a fourth
bore upon it, to show the zeal of the people, the arms of the town
of Taunton; and a fifth had both a Bible and a drawn sword; and
so forth, every one with a legend embroidered upon it plain for all
to read. The flags were affixed to stout white staves, and as the
maids walked apart from each other and at a due distance, the flags
all flying in the wind made a pretty sight indeed; so that some of
the women who looked on shed tears. Among the flags was one
which I needs must mention, because, unless the device was communicated
by some person deep in the Duke's counsels, it most
strangely jumped with the event of the following day. Mary
Meade, poor child! carried it. We called it the Golden Flag,
because it had a crown worked in gold thread upon it and the
letters 'J. R.' A fringe of lace was sewn round it, so that it was the
richest flag of all. What could the Crown with the letters 'J. R.'
mean, but that James, Duke of Monmouth, would shortly assume
the Crown of these three kingdoms?</p>

<p>Last of all walked Miss Susan Blake, and I by her side. She
bore in one hand a Bible bound in red leather, stamped with gold,
and in the other a naked sword.</p>

<p>The Duke came forth to meet us, standing bareheaded before
the porch. There were standing beside and behind him, the Lord
Grey, his two Chaplains, Dr. Hooke and Mr. Ferguson, my father,
Mr. Larke, the Baptist minister of Lyme Regis (he wore a corslet
and carried a sword), and the Colonels of his regiments. His
bodyguard were drawn up across the street, looking brave and
splendid in their new favours. The varlets waited beyond with
the horses for the Duke's party. Who, to look upon the martial
array, the bravery of the Guard, the gallant bearing of all, the
confidence in their looks, and the presence, which should surely
bring a blessing, of the ministers of religion, would think that
all this pomp and promise could be shattered at a single blow?</p>

<p>As each girl advanced in her turn, she knelt on one knee and
offered her flag, bowing her head (we had practised this ceremony<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
several times at the school until we were all quite perfect in our
parts). Then the Duke stepped forward and raised her, tenderly
kissing her. Then she stood aside holding her flag still in her
hands.</p>

<p>My turn&mdash;because I had no flag&mdash;came last but one, Miss Susan
Blake being the last. Now&mdash;I hope it was not folly, or a vainglorious
desire to be distinguished by any particular notice of his
Grace&mdash;I could not refrain from hanging the ring, which the Duke
had given me at Ilchester five years ago, outside my dress by a
blue ribbon. Miss Blake, to whom I had told the story of the
ring, advised me to do so, partly to show my loyalty to the Duke,
and partly because it was a pretty thing and one which some
women would much desire to possess.</p>

<p>Miss Katharine Bovet informed the Duke that I was the
daughter of the learned preacher, Dr. Comfort Eykin. When I
knelt he raised me. Then, as he was about to salute me, his eyes
fell upon the ring, and he looked first at me and then at the
ring.</p>

<p>'Madam,' he said, 'this ring I ought to know. If I mistake
not, there are the initials of "J. S." upon it.'</p>

<p>'Sir,' I replied, 'the ring was your own. Your Grace was so
good as to bestow it upon me in your progress through the town of
Ilchester five years ago.'</p>

<p>'Gad so!' he said, laughing; 'I remember now. 'Twas a
sweet and lovely child whom I kissed&mdash;and now thou art a sweet
and lovely maiden. Art thou truly the daughter of Dr. Comfort
Eykin?'&mdash;he looked behind him; but my father neither heard nor
attended, being wrapped in thought. ''Tis strange: his daughter!
'Tis indeed wonderful that such a child should'&mdash;&mdash;Here he
stopped. 'Fair Rose of Somerset I called thee then. Fair Rose of
Somerset I call thee again. Why, if I could place thee at the head
of my army all England would certainly follow, as if Helen of Troy
or Queen Venus herself did lead.' So he kissed me on the cheek
with much warmth&mdash;more, indeed, than was necessary to show a
gracious and friendly goodwill; and suffered me to step aside.
'Dr. Eykin's daughter!' he repeated, with a kind of wonder.
'How could Dr. Eykin have such a daughter!'</p>

<p>When I told Robin of this gracious salutation, he first turned
very red and then he laughed. Then he said that everybody
knew the Duke, but he must not attempt any Court freedoms in
the Protestant camp; and if he were to try&mdash;&mdash;Then he broke off
short, changed colour again, and then he kissed me, saying that,
of course, the Duke meant nothing but kindliness, but that, for his
own part, he desired not his sweetheart to be kissed by anybody
but himself. So I suppose my boy was jealous. But the folly of
being jealous of so great a Prince, who could not possibly have the
least regard for a simple country maiden, and who had known the
great and beautiful Court ladies! It made me laugh to think that
Robin could be so foolish as to be jealous of the Duke.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span></p>

<p>Then it was Miss Susan Blake's turn. She stepped forward
very briskly, and knelt down, and placed the Bible in the Duke's
left hand and the sword in his right.</p>

<p>'Sir,' she said (speaking the words we had made up and she
had learned), 'it is in the name of the women of Taunton&mdash;nay, of
the women of all England&mdash;that I give you the Book of the Word
of God, the most precious treasure vouchsafed to man, so that all
may learn that you are come for no other purpose than to maintain
the right of the English people to search the Scriptures for themselves.
I give you also, Sir, a sword with which to defend those
rights. In addition, Sir, the women can only give your Grace the
offering of their continual prayers in behalf of the Cause, and for
the safety and prosperity of your Highness and your army.'</p>

<p>'Madam,' said the Duke, much moved by this spectacle of
devotion, 'I am come, believe me, for no other purpose than to
defend the truths contained in this book, and to seal my defence
with my blood, if that need be.'</p>

<p>Then the Duke mounted, and we marched behind him in single
file, each girl led by a soldier, till we came to the camp, when our
flags were taken from us, and we returned home and took off our
white dresses. I confess that I laid mine down with a sigh.
White becomes every maiden, and my only wear till then had been
of russet brown. And all that day we acted over again&mdash;in our
talk and in our thoughts&mdash;our beautiful procession, and we repeated
the condescending words of the Duke, and admired the graciousness
of his kisses, and praised each other for our admirable
behaviour, and listened, with pleasure unspeakable while Susan
Blake prophesied that we should become immortal by the ceremony
of that day.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIX.</h2>

<h3>KING MONMOUTH AND HIS CAMP.</h3>


<div class="drop">
<img src="images/i_141.jpg" alt="N" width="100" height="102" class="cap" />
 <p class="cap_1">Next day, the town being thronged with people, and
the young men pressing in from all quarters to enrol
themselves (over four thousand joined the colours at
Taunton alone), another Proclamation was read&mdash;that,
namely, by which the Duke claimed the throne.
Many opinions have been given as to this step. For
the Duke's enemies maintain&mdash;first, that his mother was never
married to King Charles the Second (indeed, there is no doubt that
the King always denied the marriage); next, that an illegitimate
son could never be permitted to sit upon the ancient throne of this
realm; and, thirdly, that in usurping the Crown the Duke broke
faith with his friends, to whom he had solemnly given his word
that he would not put forward any such pretensions. Nay, some
have gone so far as to allege that he was not the son of Charles at
all, but of some other whom they even name; and they have
pointed to his face as showing no resemblance at all to that swarthy
and gloomy-looking King. On the other hand, the Duke's friends
say that there were in his hands clear proofs of the marriage; that
the promise given to his friends was conditional, and one which
could be set aside by circumstances; that the country gentry, to
whom a Republic was most distasteful, were afraid that he designed
to re-establish that form of government; and, further, that
his friends were all fully aware, from the beginning, of his
intentions.</p>
</div>

<p>On these points I know nothing; but, when a thing has been
done, it is idle to spend time in arguing that it was well or ill done.
James, Duke of Monmouth, was now James, King of Great
Britain and Ireland; and if we were all rebels before, who had
risen in the name of religion and liberty, I suppose we were all ten
times as much rebels now, when we had, in addition, set up another
King, and declared King James to be an usurper, and no more
than the Duke of York. Nay, that there might be wanting no
single circumstance of aggravation, it was in this Proclamation
declared that the Duke of York had caused his brother, the late
King, to be secretly poisoned. I know not what foundation exists
for this accusation; but I have been told that it gave offence unto
many, and that it was an ill-advised thing to say.</p>

<p>The Proclamation was read aloud at the Market Cross by Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
Tyley, of Taunton, on the Saturday morning, before a great concourse
of people. It ended with the words, 'We, therefore, the
noblemen, gentlemen, and Commons at present assembled, in the
names of ourselves and of all the loyal and Protestant noblemen,
gentlemen, and Commons of England, in pursuance of our duty
and allegiance, and for the delivering of the Kingdom from Popery,
tyranny, and oppression, do recognise, publish, and proclaim the
said high and mighty Prince James, Duke of Monmouth, as lawful
and rightful Sovereign and King, by the name of James II., by
the grace of God, King of England, Scotland, France, and Ireland,
Defender of the Faith. <span class="smcap">God save the King!</span>'</p>

<p>After this the Duke was always saluted as King, prayed for as
King, and styled 'His Majesty.' He also touched some (as only
the King can do) for the king's-evil, and, it is said, wrought many
miracles of healing&mdash;a thing which, being noised abroad, should
have strengthened the faith of the people in him. But the
malignity of our enemies caused these cases of healing to be
denied, or else explained as fables and inventions of the Duke's
friends.</p>

<p>Among the accessions of this day was one which I cannot forbear
to mention. It was that of an old soldier who had been one
of Cromwell's captains, Colonel Basset by name. He rode in&mdash;being
a man advanced in years, yet still strong and hale&mdash;at the
head of a considerable company raised by himself. 'Twas hoped
that his example would be followed by the adhesion of many more
of Cromwell's men, but the event proved otherwise. Perhaps,
being old Republicans, they were deterred by the Proclamation of
Monmouth as King. Perhaps they had grown slothful with age,
and were now unwilling to face once more the dangers and fatigues
of a campaign. Another recruit was the once-famous Colonel
Perrot, who had been engaged with Colonel Blood in the robbery
of the Crown Jewels&mdash;though the addition of a robber to our army
was not a matter of pride. He came, it was afterwards said, because
he was desperate, his fortunes broken, and with no other
hope than to follow the fortunes of the Duke.</p>

<p>It became known in the course of the day that the army was to
march on the Sunday. Therefore, everybody on Saturday evening
repaired to the camp: some to bid farewell and Godspeed to their
friends, and others to witness the humours of a camp. I was fortunate
in having Robin for a companion and protector&mdash;the place
being rough and the behaviour and language of the men coarse even
beyond what one expects at a country fair. The recruits still kept
pouring in from all parts; but, as I have already said, many were
disheartened when they found that there were no arms, and went
home again. They were not all riotous and disorderly. Some
of the men, those, namely, who were older and more sober-minded,
we found gathered together in groups, earnestly engaged
in conversation.</p>

<p>'They are considering the Proclamation,' said Robin. 'Truly,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
we did not expect that our Duke would so soon become King.
They say he is illegitimate. What then? Let him mount the
throne by right of arms, as Oliver Cromwell could have done had
he pleased&mdash;who asks whether Oliver was illegitimate or no? The
country will not have another Commonwealth&mdash;and it will no
longer endure a Catholic King. Let us have King Monmouth,
then: who is there better?'</p>

<p>In all the camp there was none who spoke with greater cheerfulness
and confidence than Robin. Yet he did not disguise from
himself that there might be warm work.</p>

<p>'The King's troops,' he said, 'are closing in all round us. That
is certain. Yet, even if they all join we are still more numerous
and in much better heart; of that I am assured. At Wellington,
the Duke of Albemarle commands the Devonshire Militia; Lord
Churchill is at Chard with the Somerset Regiment; Lord Bath is
reported to be marching upon us with the Cornishmen; the Duke of
Beaufort hath the Gloucester Militia at Bristol; Lord Pembroke is
at Chippenham with the Wiltshire Trainbands; Lord Feversham is
on the march with the King's standing army. What then? are
these men Protestants or are they Papists? Answer me that,
Sweetheart.'</p>

<p>Alas! had they been true Protestants there would have been
such an answer as would have driven King James across the water
three years sooner.</p>

<p>The camp was now like a fair, only much finer and bigger than
any fair I have ever seen. That of Lyme Regis could not be compared
with it. There were booths where they sold gingerbread,
cakes, ale, and cider; Monmouth favours for the recruits to sew
upon their hats or sleeves; shoes and stockings were sold in some,
and even chap-books were displayed. There was a puppet show
with Patient Grizzle; and a stand where a monkey danced. Men
and women carried about in baskets last year's withered apples,
with Kentish cobs and walnuts; there were booths where they
fried sausages and roasted pork all day long; tumblers and clowns
were performing in others; painted and dressed-up girls danced in
others; there was a bull-baiting; a man was making a fiery oration
on the Duke's Proclamation: but I saw no one preaching a sermon.
There were here and there companies of country lads exercising
with pike and halbert; and others, more advanced, with the loading
and firing of their muskets. There were tables at which sat
men with cards and dice, gambling: shouting when they won and
cursing when they lost; others, of more thrifty mind, sat on the
ground practising their trade of tailor or cobbler&mdash;thus losing no
money, though they did go soldiering; some polished weapons and
sharpened swords, pikes, and scythes; nowhere did we find any
reading the Bible, or singing of hymns, or listening to sermons.
Save for a few groups of sober men of whom I have spoken, the
love of amusement carried all away; and the officers of the army,
who might have turned them back to sober thought, were not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
visible. Everywhere noise; everywhere beating of drums, playing of
pipes, singing of songs, bowling and laughing. Among the men
there ran about a number of saucy gipsy girls, their brown faces
showing under red kerchiefs, their black eyes twinkling (truly they
are pretty creatures to look upon when they are young; but they
have no religion, and say of themselves that they have no souls).
These girls talked with each other in their own language, which
none out of their own nation&mdash;except the tinker-folk, who are said
to be their cousins&mdash;understand. But English they talk very well,
and they are so clever that, it is said, they will talk to a Somersetshire
man in good broad Somerset, and to a man of Norfolk in his
own speech, though he of Norfolk would not understand him of
Somerset.</p>

<p>'They are the vultures,' said Robin, 'who follow for prey. Before
the battle these women cajole the soldiers out of their money, and
after the battle their men rob and even murder the wounded and
plunder the dead.'</p>

<p>Then one of them ran and stood before us.</p>

<p>'Let me tell thy fortune, handsome gentleman? Let me tell
thine, fair lady? A sixpence or a groat to cross my palm, Captain,
and you shall know all that is to happen.'</p>

<p>Robin laughed, but gave her sixpence.</p>

<p>'Look me in the face, fair lady'&mdash;she spoke good, plain English,
this black-eyed wench, though but a moment before she had been
talking broad Somerset to a young recruit&mdash;'look me in the face;
yes. All is not smooth. He loves you; but there will be separation
and trouble. One comes between, a big man with a red face;
he parts you. There is a wedding, I see your ladyship plain. Why,
you are crying at it, you cry all the time; but I do not see this
gentleman. Then there is another wedding&mdash;yes, another&mdash;and I
see you at both. You will be twice married. Yet, be of good
heart, fair lady.'</p>

<p>She turned away and ran after another couple, no doubt with
much the same tale.</p>

<p>'How should there be a wedding,' I asked, 'if I am there and
you not there, Robin&mdash;and I to be crying? And how could I&mdash;oh!
Robin&mdash;how could I be married twice?'</p>

<p>'Nay, Sweetheart, she could not tell what wedding it was. She
only uttered the gibberish of her trade; I am sorry that I wasted a
sixpence upon her.'</p>

<p>'Robin, is it magic that they practise&mdash;these gipsies? Do they
traffic with the Devil? We ought not to suffer witches to live
amongst us.'</p>

<p>'Most are of opinion that they have no other magic than the art
of guessing, which they learn to do very quickly, putting things
together, from their appearance; so that if brother and sister walk
out together they are taken to be lovers, and promised a happy
marriage and many children.'</p>

<p>That may be so, and perhaps the fortune told by this gipsy was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
only guess-work. But I cannot believe it; for the event proved
that she had in reality possessed an exact knowledge of what was
about to happen.</p>

<p>Some of the gipsy women&mdash;but these were the older women, who
had lost their good looks, though not their impudence&mdash;were singing
songs, and those, as Robin told me, songs not fit to be sung;
and one old crone, sitting before her tent beside a roaring wood fire
over which hung a great saucepan, sold charms against shot and
steel. The lads bought these greedily, giving sixpence apiece for
them; so that the old witch must have made a sackful of money.
They came and looked on shyly. Then one would say to the other,
'What thinkest, lad? Is there aught in it?' And the other would
say, 'Truly, I know not; but she is a proper witch, and I'll buy
one. We may have to fight. Best make sure of a whole skin.'
And so he bought one, and then all bought. The husbands of the
gipsy women were engaged, meantime, we understood, in robbing
the farm-yards in the neighbourhood, the blame being afterwards
laid upon our honest soldiers.</p>

<p>Then there was a ballad-monger singing a song about a man
and a broom, and selling it (to those who would buy) printed on a
long slip of paper. The first lines were&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">There was an old man and he lived in a wood,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And his trade it was making a broom,<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noind">but I heard no more, because Robin hurried me away. Then there
were some who had drunk too much cider or beer, and were now
reeling about with stupid faces and glassy eyes; there were some
who were lying speechless or asleep upon the grass; and some were
cooking supper over fires after the manner of the gipsies.</p>

<p>'I have seen enough, Robin,' I said. 'Alas for sacred Religion
if these are her defenders!'</p>

<p>''Tis always so,' said Robin, 'in time of war. We must encourage
our men to keep up their hearts. Should we be constantly reminding
them that to-morrow half of them may be lying dead on the
battle-field? Then they would mope and hang their heads, and
would presently desert.'</p>

<p>'One need not preach of death, but one should preach of godliness
and of sober joy. Look but at those gipsy wenches and those
lads rolling about drunk. Are these things decent? If they escape
the dangers of war, will it make them happy to look back upon the
memory of this camp? Is it fit preparation to meet their Maker?'</p>

<p>'In times of peace, sweet Saint, these lads remember easily
that in the midst of life we are in death, and they govern themselves
accordingly. In times of war, every man hopes for his own
part to escape with a whole skin, though his neighbour fall. That
is why we are all so blithe and jolly. Let us now go home&mdash;before
the night falls and the mirth becomes riotous and unseemly.'</p>

<p>We passed a large booth, whence there issued sounds of singing.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
It was a roofless inclosure of canvas. Some ale-house man of Taunton
had set it up. Robin drew aside the canvas door.</p>

<p>'Look in,' he said. 'See the brave defenders of Religion keeping
up their hearts.'</p>

<p>It was furnished with benches and rough tables: at one end
were casks. The benches were crowded with soldiers, every man
with a pot before him, and the varlets were running backwards and
forwards with cans of ale and cider. Most of the men were smoking
pipes of tobacco, and they were singing a song which seemed to have
no end. One bawled the lines, and when it came to the 'Let the
hautboys play!' and the 'Huzza!' they all roared out together:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Now, now, the Duke's health,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And let the hautboys play,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While the troops on their march shall roar<br /></span>
<span class="i32">Huzza! huzza! huzza!<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Now, now, the Duke's health,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And let the hautboys play,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While the drums and the trumpets sound from the shore<br /></span>
<span class="i32">Huzza! huzza! huzza!<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noind">They sang this verse several times over. Then another began&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Now, now, Lord Grey's health,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And let the hautboys play,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While the troops on their march shall roar<br /></span>
<span class="i32">Huzza! huzza! huzza!<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Now, now, Lord Grey's health,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And let the hautboys play,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While the drums and the trumpets sound from the shore<br /></span>
<span class="i32">Huzza! huzza! huzza!<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noind">Next a third voice took it up&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Now, now, the Colonel's health,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And let the hautboys play,<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noind">and then a fourth and a fifth, and the last verse was bawled as
lustily and with so much joy that one would have thought the
mere singing would have gotten them the victory. Men are so
made, I suppose, that they cannot work together without singing
and music to keep up their hearts. Sailors sing when they weigh
anchor; men who unlade ships sing as they carry out the bales;
even Cromwell's Ironsides could not march in silence, but sang
Psalms as they marched.</p>

<p>The sun was set and the twilight falling when we left the camp;
and there was no abatement of the roaring and singing, but rather
an increase.</p>

<p>'They will go on,' said Robin, 'until the drink or their money
gives out; then they will lie down and sleep. You have now seen
our camp, Sweetheart. It is not, truth to say, as decorous as a
conventicle, nor is the talk so godly as in Sir Christopher's hall.
For rough fellows there must be rough play; in a month these lads
will be veterans; the singing will have grown stale to them; the
black-eyed gipsy-women will have no more power to charm away<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
their money; they will understand the meaning of war; the camp
will be sober if it is not religious.'</p>

<p>So we walked homewards, I, for my part, saddened to think in
what a spirit of riot these young men, whom I had pictured so full
of godly zeal, were preparing to meet the chance of immediate
death and judgment.</p>

<p>'Sweet,' said Robin, 'I read thy thoughts in thy troubled eyes.
Pray for us. Some will fight none the worse for knowing that
there are good women who pray for them.'</p>

<p>We were now back in the town; the streets were still full of
people, and no one seemed to think of bed. Presently we passed
the Castle Inn; the windows were open, and we could see a great
company of gentlemen sitting round a table on which were candles
lit and bowls full of strong drink; nearly every man had his pipe
at his lips and his glass before him, and one of them was singing
to the accompaniment of a guitar. Their faces were red and
swollen, as if they had taken too much. At one end of the table
sat Humphrey. What? could Humphrey, too, be a reveller with
the rest? His face, which was gloomy, and his eyes, which were
sad, showed that he was not.</p>

<p>'The officers have supped together,' said Robin. 'It may be
long before we get such good quarters again. A cup of hipsy and
a song in good fellowship, thou wilt not grudge so much?'</p>

<p>'Nay,' I said, ''tis all of a piece. Like man, like master.
Officers and men alike&mdash;all drinking and singing. Is there not one
good man in all the army?'</p>

<p>As I spoke one finished a song at which all laughed, except
Humphrey, and drummed the table with their fists and shouted.</p>

<p>Then one who seemed to be the president of the table turned to
Humphrey.</p>

<p>'Doctor,' he said, 'thou wilt not drink, thou dost not laugh,
and thou hast not sung. Thou must be tried by court-martial, and
the sentence of the court is a brimming glass of punch or a song.'</p>

<p>'Then, gentlemen,' said Humphrey, smiling, 'I will give you
a song. But blame me not if you mislike it: I made the song in
praise of the sweetest woman in the world.' He took the guitar
and struck the strings. When he began to sing, my cheeks flamed
and my breath came and went, for I knew the song; he had given
it to me four years agone. Who was the sweetest woman in the
world? Oh! he made this song for me!&mdash;he made this song for
me, and none but me! But these rude revellers would not know
that&mdash;and I never guessed that the song was for me. How could
I think that he would write these extravagances for me? But
poets cannot mean what they say&mdash;</p>

<span class="i2">The twinkling stars beside;</span>
<span class="i0">As when in splendour she doth rise,</span>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">As Helen in the town of Troy</span>
<span class="i2">Shone fair beyond all thought,</span>
<span class="i0">That to behold her was a joy</span>

<span class="i4">So when fair Celia deigns the lawn to grace,</span>
<span class="i4">All life, all joy, dwells in her lovely face.</span>

<span class="i4">So Celia, though thou Queen and Empress art,</span>
<span class="i4">To heaven, to heaven alone, belongs thy heart.</span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>Now, while Humphrey sang this song, a hush fell upon the
revellers; they had expected nothing but a common drinking-song.
After the bawling and the noise and the ribaldry 'twas like a breath
of fresh air after the closeness of a prison; or like a drink of pure
water to one half-dead with thirst.</p>

<p>'Robin,' I said, 'there is one good man in the camp.' I say
that while Humphrey sang this song&mdash;which, to be sure, was
neither a drinking-song, nor a party song, nor a song of wickedness
and folly&mdash;the company looked at each other in silence, and
neither laughed nor offered to interrupt. Nay, there were signs of
grace in some of their faces, which became grave and thoughtful.
When Humphrey finished it he laid down the guitar and rose up
with a bow, saying, 'I have sung my song, gentlemen all&mdash;and so,
good-night!' and walked out of the room.</p>

<p>'Robin,' I said again, 'thank God there is one good man in
the camp! I had forgotten Humphrey.'</p>

<p>'Yes,' Robin replied; 'Humphrey is a good man, if ever there
was one. But he is glum. Something oppresses him. His eyes
are troubled, and he hangs his head; or, if he laughs at all, it is as
if he would rather cry. Yet all the way home from Holland he
was joyful, save when his head was held over the side of the ship.
He sang and laughed; he spoke of great things about to happen.
I have never known him more happy. And now his face is gloomy,
and he sighs when he thinks no one watcheth him. Perhaps, like
thee, Sweet, he cannot abide the noise and riot of the camp. He
would fain see every man Bible in hand. To-day he spent two
hours with the Duke before the Council, and was with thy father
afterwards. 'Tis certain that the Duke hath great confidence in
him. Why is he so gloomy? He bitterly reproached me for leaving
Sir Christopher, as if he alone had a conscience to obey or
honour to remember!'</p>

<p>Humphrey came forth at this moment and stood for a moment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
on the steps. Then he heaved a great sigh and walked away slowly
with hanging head, not seeing us.</p>

<p>'What is the matter with him?' said Robin. 'Perhaps they
flout him for being a physician. These fellows have no respect
for learning or for anyone who is not a country gentleman. Well,
perhaps when we are on the march he will again pick up his spirits.
They are going to sing again. Shall we go, Child?'</p>

<p>But the president called a name which made me stop a little
longer.</p>

<p>'Barnaby!' he cried; 'jolly Captain Barnaby! Now that
Doctor Graveairs hath left us we will begin the night. Barnaby,
my hero, thy song. Pill up, gentlemen! The night is young, and
to-morrow we march. Captain Barnaby, tip us a sea-song. Silence,
gentlemen, for the Captain's song.'</p>

<p>It was my brother that they called upon&mdash;no other. He got up
from his place at the summons and rose to his feet. Heavens!
what a broad man he seemed compared with those who sat beside
him! His face was red and his cheeks swollen because of the
strong drink he had taken. In his hand he held a full glass of it.
Robin called it hipsy&mdash;and it is a mixture of wine, brandy, and
water with lemon juice and sugar&mdash;very heady and strong.</p>

<p>Said not Barnaby that there was one religion for a landsman
and another for a sailor? I thought of that as he stood looking
round him. If it were so, it would be truly a happy circumstance
for most sailors; but I know not on what assurance this belief can
be argued. Then Barnaby waved his hand.</p>

<p>'Yoho! my lads!' he shouted. 'The ship's in port and the
crew has gone ashore!'</p>

<p>Then he began to sing in a deep voice which made the glasses
ring&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<h2>CHAPTER XX.</h2>

<h3>BENJAMIN'S WARNING.</h3>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 240px;">
<img src="images/i_150.jpg" width="240" height="350" alt="Since" />
</div>

<p>Since I have so much to tell, before
long, of Benjamin's evil
conduct, it must in justice
be recorded of him that at
this juncture he endeavoured,
knowing more of the world
than we of Somerset, to warn
and dissuade his cousins from
taking part in any attempt
which should be made in the
West. And this he did by
means of a letter written to
his father. I know not how
far the letter might have succeeded,
but, unfortunately, it arrived two
or three days too late&mdash;when our boys
had already joined the insurgents.</p>

<p>'Honoured Sir,' he wrote, 'I write this
epistle, being much concerned in spirit lest
my grandfather, whose opinions are well
known, not only in his own county, but
also at the Court, should be drawn into, or
become cognisant of, some attempt to raise
the West Country against their lawful King.
It will not be news to you that the Earl of
Argyle hath landed in Scotland, where he will meet with such a
reception which will doubtless cause him to repent of his rashness.
It is also currently reported, and everywhere believed, that the
Duke of Monmouth intends immediately to embark and cross the
sea, with the design of raising the country in rebellion. The Dissenters,
who have been going about with sour looks for five-and-twenty
years, venture now to smile and look pleased in anticipation
of another civil war. This may follow, but its termination, I think,
will not be what they expect.</p>

<p>'I have also heard that my cousin Humphrey, Dr. Eykin's
favourite pupil, who hath never concealed his opinions, hath lately
returned from Holland (where the exiles are gathered), and passed
through London accompanied by Robin. I have further learned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
that while in London he visited (but alone, without Robin's knowledge)
many of those who are known to be friends of the Duke and
red-hot Protestants. Wherefore, I greatly fear that he hath been
in correspondence with the exiles, and is cognisant of their designs,
and may even be their messenger to announce the intentions of his
Protestant champion. Certain I am that should any chance occur
of striking a blow for freedom of worship, my cousin, though he is
weak and of slender frame, will join the attempt. He will also
endeavour to draw after him everyone in his power. Therefore,
my dear father, use all your influence to withstand him, and, if he
must for his own part plunge into ruin, persuade my grandfather
and my cousin Robin to stay quiet at home.</p>

<p>'I hear it on the best authority that the temper of the country,
and especially in your part of it, hath been carefully studied by
the Government, and is perfectly well known. Those who would
risk life and lands for the Duke of Monmouth are few indeed. He
may, perhaps, draw a rabble after him, but no more. The fat
tradesmen, who most long for the conventicle, will not fight,
though they may pray for him. The country gentlemen may be
Protestants, but they are mostly for Church and King. It is quite
true that his Majesty is a Roman Catholic, nor hath he ever concealed
or denied his religion, being one who scorns deception. It
is also true that his profession of faith is a stumbling-block to
many who find it hard to reconcile their teaching of Non-Resistance
and Divine Right with the introduction of the Mass and the
Romish Priest. But the country had not yet forgotten the sour
rule of the Independent; and, rather than suffer him to return,
the people will endure a vast deal of Royal Prerogative.</p>

<p>'It is absolutely certain&mdash;assure my grandfather on this point,
whatever he may learn from Humphrey&mdash;that the better sort will
never join Monmouth, whether he comes as another Cromwell to
restore the Commonwealth, or whether he aspires to the Crown
and dares to maintain&mdash;a thing which King Charles did always
stoutly deny&mdash;that his mother was married. Is it credible that the
ancient throne of these Kingdoms should be usurped by the base-born
son of Lucy Waters?</p>

<p>'I had last night the honour of drinking a bottle of wine with
that great lawyer, Sir George Jeffreys. The conversation turned
upon this subject. We were assured by the Judge that the affections
of the people are wholly with the King; that the liberty of
worship which he demands for himself he will also willingly extend
to the country, so that the last pretence of reason for disaffection
shall be removed. Why should the people run after Monmouth,
when, if he were successful, he could give no more than the King is
ready to give? I was also privately warned by Sir George that
my grandfather's name is unfavourably noted, and his actions and
speeches will be watched. Therefore, Sir, I humbly beg that you
will represent to him and to my cousins, and to Dr. Eykin himself,
first the hopelessness of any such enterprise and the certainty of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
defeat; and next the punishment which will fall upon the rebels
and upon those who lend them any countenance. Men of such a
temper as Dr. Comfort Eykin will, doubtless, go to the scaffold
willingly with their mouths full of the texts which they apply to
themselves on all occasions. For such I have no pity, yet for the
sake of his wife and daughter I would willingly, if I could, save
him from the fate which will be his if Monmouth lands in the
West. And as for my grandfather, 'tis terrible to think of his
white hairs blown by the breeze while the hangman adjusts the
knot; and I should shudder to see the blackened limbs of Robin
stuck upon poles for all the world to see.</p>

<p>'It is my present intention, if my affairs permit, to follow my
fortunes on the Western Circuit in the autumn, when I shall
endeavour to ride from Taunton or Exeter to Bradford Orcas. My
practice grows apace. Daily I am heard in the Courts. The
Judges already know me and listen to me. The juries begin to
feel the weight of my arguments. The attorneys besiege my
chambers. For a junior I am in great demand. It is my prayer
that you, Sir, may live to see your son Chancellor and a Peer of the
realm. Less than Lord Chancellor will not content me. As for
marriage, that might hinder my rise; I shall not marry yet. There
is in your parish, Sir, one who knows my mind upon this matter.
I shall be pleased to think that you will assure her&mdash;you know
very well whom I mean&mdash;that my mind is unaltered, and that my
way is now plain before me. So, I remain, with dutiful respect,
your obedient son,</p>

<p class="sig">B. B.'
</p>

<p>This letter arrived, I say, after the departure of Robin with his
company of village lads.</p>

<p>When Mr. Boscorel had read it slowly and twice over, so as to
lose no point of the contents, he sat and pondered awhile. Then
he arose, and with troubled face he sought Sir Christopher, to
whom he read it through. Then he waited for Sir Christopher to
speak.</p>

<p>'The boy writes,' said his Honour, after a while, 'according to
his lights. He repeats the things he hears said by his boon companions.
Nay, more, he believes them. Why, it is easy for them
to swear loyalty and to declare in their cups where the affections of
the people are placed.'</p>

<p>'Sir Christopher, what is done cannot be undone. The boys
are gone&mdash;alas!&mdash;but you still remain. Take heed for a space what
you say as well as what you do.'</p>

<p>'How should they know the temper of the country?' Sir
Christopher went on, regardless. 'What doth the foul-mouthed
profligate Sir George Jeffreys know concerning sober and godly
people? These are not noisy Templars; they are not profligates of
the Court; they are not haunters of tavern and pot-house; they
are not those who frequent the play-house. Judge Jeffreys knows
none such. They are lovers of the Word of God; they wish to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
worship after their fashion; they hate the Pope and all his works.
Let us hear what these men say upon the matter.'</p>

<p>'Nay,' said Mr. Boscorel; 'I care not greatly what they say.
But would to God the boys were safe returned.'</p>

<p>'Benjamin means well,' Sir Christopher went on. 'I take this
warning kindly; he means well. It pleases me that in the midst
of the work and the feasting, which he loves, he thinks upon us.
Tell him, son-in-law, that I thank him for his letter. It shows
that he hath preserved a good heart.'</p>

<p>'As for his good heart'&mdash;Mr. Boscorel stroked his nose with his
forefinger&mdash;'so long as Benjamin gets what he wants&mdash;which is
Benjamin's mess, and five times the mess of any other&mdash;there is no
doubt of his good heart.'</p>

<p>'Worse things than these,' said Sir Christopher, 'were said of
us when the civil wars began. The King's troops would ride us
down; the country would not join us; those of us who were not
shot or cut down in the field would be afterwards hanged, drawn,
and quartered. Yet we drove the King from his throne.'</p>

<p>'And then another King came back again. So we go up, and so
we go down. But about this expedition and about these boys my
mind misgives me.'</p>

<p>'Son-in-law,' Sir Christopher said solemnly, 'I am now old,
and the eyes of my mind are dim, so that I no longer discern the
signs of the times, or follow the current of the stream; moreover,
we hear but little news, so that I cannot even see any of those
signs. Yet to men in old age, before they pass away to the rest
provided by the Lord, there cometh sometimes a vision by which
they are enabled to see clearly when younger men are still groping
their way in a kind of twilight. Monmouth hath landed; my boys
are with him; they are rebels; should the rising fail, their lives
are forfeit; and that of my dear friend Dr. Comfort Eykin's&mdash;yea,
and my life as well belike, because I have been a consenting
party. Ruin and death will in that event fall upon all of us.
Whether it will so happen I know not, nor do I weigh the chance
of that event against the voice of conscience, duty, and honour.
My boys have obeyed that voice; they have gone forth to conquer
or to die. My vision doth not tell me what will happen to them.
But it shows me the priest flying from the country, the King flying
from the throne, and that fair angel, whom we call Freedom of
Conscience, returning to bless the land. To know that the laws of
God will triumph&mdash;ought not that to reconcile a man, already
seventy-five years of age, to death, even a death upon the gallows?
What matter for this earthly body so that it be spent until the end
in the service of the Lord?'</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXI.</h2>

<h3>WE WAIT FOR THE END.</h3>


<div class="drop">
<img src="images/i_154.jpg" alt="I" width="100" height="99" class="cap" />
 <p class="cap_1">I have said that my father from the beginning unto
the end of this business was as one beside himself,
being in an ecstasy or rapture of mind insomuch
that he heeded nothing. The letters he sent out to
his friends, the Nonconformists, either brought no
answer or else they heaped loads of trouble, being
intercepted and read, upon those to whom they were addressed.
But he was not moved. The defection of his friends and of the
gentry caused him no uneasiness. Nay, he even closed his eyes
and ears to the drinking, the profane oaths, and the riotous living
in the camp. Others there were, like-minded with himself, who
saw the hand of the Lord in this enterprise, and thought that it
would succeed by a miracle. The desertions of the men, which
afterwards followed, and the defection of those who should have
joined&mdash;these things were but the weeding of the host, which
should be still further weeded&mdash;as in a well-known chapter in the
Book of Judges&mdash;until none but the righteous should be left behind.
These things he preached daily, and with mighty fervour,
to all who would listen; but these were few in number.</p>
</div>

<p>As regards his wife and daughter he took no thought for them
at all, being wholly enwrapped in his work; he did not so much
as ask if we had money&mdash;to be sure, for five-and-twenty years he
had never asked that question&mdash;or if we were safely bestowed; or
if we were well. Never have I seen any man so careless of all
earthly affections when he considered the work of the Lord. But
when the time came for the army to march, what were we to do?
Where should we be bestowed?</p>

<p>'As to following the army,' said Robin, 'that is absurd. We
know not whither we may march or what the course of events may
order. You cannot go home without an armed escort, for the
country is up; the clubmen are out everywhere to protect their
cattle and horses, a rough and rude folk they would be to meet;
and the gipsies are robbing and plundering. Can you stay here
until we come back, or until the country hath settled down
again?'</p>

<p>Miss Blake generously promised that we should stay with her
as long as we chose, adding many kind things about myself, out of
friendship and a good heart; and so it was resolved that we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
should remain in Taunton, where no harm could befall us, while
my father still accompanied the army to exhort the soldiers.</p>

<p>'I will take care of him,' said Barnaby. 'He shall not preach
of a morning till he hath taken breakfast, nor shall he go to bed
until he hath had his supper. So long as the provisions last out
he shall have his ration. After that I cannot say. Maybe we
shall all go on short commons, as hath happened to me already;
and, truth to tell, I love it not. All these things belong to the
voyage, and are part of our luck. Farewell, therefore, mother.
Heart up!&mdash;all will go well! Kiss me, Sis; we shall all come
back again. Never fear. King Monmouth shall be crowned in
Westminster. Dad shall be Archbishop of Canterbury, and I
shall be Captain of a King's ship. All our fortunes shall be made,
and you, Sis, shall have a great estate, and shall marry whom you
please&mdash;Robin or another. As for the gentry who have not come
forward, hang 'em, we'll divide their estates between us and so
change places, and they will be so astonished at not being shot for
cowardice that they will rejoice and be glad to clean our boots.
Thus shall we all be happy.'</p>

<p>So they marched away, Monmouth being now at the head of
an army seven thousand strong, and all in such spirits that you
would have thought nothing could withstand them. And when I
consider, and remember how that army marched away, with the
cheers of the men and the laughter and jokes of the young recruits,
the tears run down my cheeks for thinking how their joy
was turned to mourning, and life was exchanged for death. The
last I saw of Robin was that he was turning in his saddle to wave
his hand, his face full of confidence and joy. The only gloomy
face in the whole army that morning was the face of Humphrey.
Afterwards I learned that almost from the beginning he foresaw
certain disaster. In the first place, none of those on whom the
exiles of Holland had relied came into camp. These were the
backbone of the Protestant party&mdash;the sturdy blood that had been
freely shed against Charles I. This was a bitter disappointment.
Next, he saw in the army nothing but a rabble of country lads,
with such officers as Captain Hucker, the Serge-maker, instead of
the country gentlemen, with their troops, as had been expected;
and from the beginning he distrusted the leaders&mdash;even the Duke
himself. So he hung his head and laughed not with the rest.
But his doubts he kept locked up in his own heart. Robin knew
none of them.</p>

<p>It was a pretty sight to see the Taunton maids walking out for a
mile and more with their lovers who had joined Monmouth. They
walked hand-in-hand with the men; they wore the Monmouth
favours; they had no more doubt or fear of the event than their
sweethearts. Those who visit Taunton now may see these women
(now grown old) creeping about the streets lonely and sorrowful,
mindful still of that Sunday morning when they saw their
lovers for the last time.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span></p>

<p>When I consider the history of this expedition I am amazed
that it did not succeed. It was, surely, by a special judgment of
God that the victory was withheld from Monmouth and reserved
for William. I say not (presumptuously) that the judgment was
pronounced against the Duke on account of his sinful life, but I
think it was the will of Heaven that the country should endure
for three years the presence of a Prince who was continually seeking
to advance the Catholic religion. The people were not yet
ripe, perhaps, for that universal disgust which caused them without
bloodshed (in this island at least) to pull down King James
from his throne. When, I say, I consider the temper and the
courage of that great army which left Taunton, greater than any
which the King could bring against it; when I consider the multitudes
who flocked to the standard at Bridgwater, I am lost in
wonder at the event.</p>

<p>From Sunday, the 21st, when the army marched out of Taunton,
till the news came of their rout on Sedgemoor, we heard nothing
certain about them. On Tuesday the Duke of Albemarle, hearing
that the army had gone, occupied Taunton with the Militia, and
there were some who expected severities on account of the welcome
given to the Duke and the recruits whom he obtained here. But
there were no acts of revenge that I heard of&mdash;and, indeed, he did
not stay long in the town. As for us, we remained under the
shelter of Miss Blake's roof, and daily expected news of some great
and signal victory. But none came, save one letter. Every day
we looked for this news, and every day we planned and laid down
the victorious march for our army.</p>

<p>'They will first occupy Bristol,' said Miss Blake. 'That is certain,
because there are many stout Protestants in Bristol, and the
place is important. Once master of that great city, our King will
get possession of ships, and so will have a fleet. There are, no
doubt, plenty of arms in the town, with which he will be able to
equip an army ten times greater than that which he now has.
Then with&mdash;say, thirty thousand men&mdash;he will march on London.
The Militia will, of course, lay down their arms or desert at the
approach of this great and resolute army. The King's regiments
will prove, I expect, to be Protestants, every man. Oxford will
open her gates, London will send out her train-bands to welcome
the Deliverer, and so our King will enter in triumph and be
crowned at Westminster Abbey, one King James succeeding
another. Then there shall be restored to this distracted country'&mdash;being
a schoolmistress, Miss Blake could use language worthy of
the dignity of history&mdash;'the blessings of religious freedom; and
the pure Word of God, stripped of superstitious additions made
by man, shall be preached through the length and breadth of the
land.'</p>

<p>'What shall be done,' I asked, 'with the Bishops?'</p>

<p>'They shall be suffered to remain,' she said, speaking with a
voice of authority, 'for those congregations which desire a prelacy,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
but stripped of their titles and of their vast revenues. We will
not persecute, but we will never suffer one Church to lord it over
another. Oh! when will the news come? Where is the army
now?'</p>

<p>The letter of which I have spoken was from Robin.</p>

<p>'Sweetheart,' he said, 'all goes well so far. At Bridgwater
we have received a welcome only second to that of Taunton. The
Mayor and Aldermen proclaimed our King at the High Cross, and
the people have sent to the camp great store of provisions and
arms of all kinds. We are now six regiments of foot with a
thousand cavalry, besides the King's own body-guard. We have
many good friends at Bridgwater, especially one, Mr. Roger Hoar,
who is a rich merchant of the place, and is very zealous in the
Cause. Your father preached on Sunday evening from the text
(Deuteronomy vii. 5), "Ye shall destroy their altars, and break down
their images, and cut down their groves, and burn their graven
images with fire." It was a most moving discourse, which fired the
hearts of all who heard it.</p>

<p>'They say that our chief is downhearted because the nobility
and gentry have not come in. They only wait for the first victory,
after which they will come in by hundreds. But some of our men
look forward to depriving them of their estates, and dividing them
among themselves; and already the Colonels and Majors are beginning
to reckon up the great rewards which await them. As for
me, there is but one reward for which I pray&mdash;namely, to return
unto Bradford Orcas and to the arms of my sweet saint. Lord
Churchill is reported to be at Chard; there has been a brush in the
Forest of Neroche between the scouts, and it is said that all the
roads are guarded so that recruits shall be arrested or at least
driven back. Perhaps this is the reason why the gentry sit down.
Barnaby says that so far there have been provisions enough and to
spare; and he hopes the present plenty may continue. No ship's
crew can fight, he says, on half rations. Our march will be on
Bristol. I hope and believe that when we have gotten that great
town our end is sure. Humphrey continueth glum.'</p>

<p>Many women there were who passed that time in prayer, continually
offering up supplications on behalf of husband, brother,
lover or son. But at Taunton the Vicar, one Walter Harte, a
zealous High Churchman, came forth from hiding, and, with the
magistrates, said prayers daily for King James II.</p>

<p>To tell what follows is to renew a time of agony unspeakable.
Yet must it be told. Farewell, happy days of hope and confidence!
Farewell, the sweet exchange of dreams! Farewell to our lovely
hero, the gracious Duke! All the troubles that man's mind can
conceive were permitted to be rained upon our heads&mdash;defeat,
wounds, death, prison&mdash;nay, for me such a thing as no one could
have expected or even feared&mdash;such a fate as never entered the
mind of man to invent.</p>

<p>When the Duke marched out of Bridgwater, across Sedgemoor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
to Glastonbury, the weather, which had been hot and fine, became
cold and rainy, which made the men uncomfortable. At Glastonbury
they camped in the ruins of the old abbey. Thence they
went to Shepton Mallet, the spirits of the men still being high.
From Shepton Mallet they marched to a place called Pensford,
only five miles from Bristol. Here they heard that the bridge
over the Avon at Keynsham was broken down. This being presently
repaired, the army marched across. They were then within
easy reach of Bristol.</p>

<p>And now began the disasters of the enterprise. Up to this
time everything had prospered. Had the Duke boldly attacked
Bristol&mdash;I speak not of my own wisdom, having none in such
matters, but from others' wisdom&mdash;he would have encountered no
more than twenty companies or thereabouts of Militia, and a regiment
of two hundred and fifty horse. Moreover, Bristol was full
of Dissenters, who wanted nothing but encouragement to join the
Protestant champion. Not only the Duke's friends, but also his
enemies, agree in declaring that it wanted nothing but courage to
take that great, rich, and populous city, where he would have
found everything that he wanted&mdash;men and money, arms and
ammunition. I cannot but think that for his sins, or for the sins
of the nation, a judicial blindness was caused to fall upon the
Duke, so that he chose, of two ways open to him, that which led
to his destruction. In short, he turned away from Bristol, and
drew up his forces against Bath. When he summoned that city to
surrender, they shot his herald, and scoffed at him. Then, instead
of taking the town, the Duke retired to Philip's Norton, where,
'tis said, he expected some great reinforcements. But none came;
and he now grew greatly dejected, showing his dejection in his
face, which could conceal nothing. Yet he fought an action with
his half-brother, the Duke of Grafton, in which he was victorious,
a thing which ought to have helped him. In this action Lieutenant
Blake, Miss Blake's cousin, was killed. From Philip's Norton
the army marched to Frome, and here such was the general
despondency that two thousand men&mdash;a third of the whole army&mdash;deserted
in the night and returned to their own homes. I think,
also, it was at Frome that they learned the news of Lord Argyle's
discomfiture.</p>

<p>Then a council was held, at which it was proposed that the
army should be disbanded and ordered to return, seeing that the
King had proclaimed a pardon to all who would peacefully lay
down their arms and return home; and that the Duke, with Lord
Grey, and those who would be certainly exempted from that
pardon, should make the best of their way out of the country.</p>

<p>Alas! here was a way open to the safety of all those poor men;
but again was the Duke permitted to choose the other way&mdash;that,
namely, which led to the destruction of his army and himself. Yet
they say that he himself recommended the safer course. He must
have known that he wanted arms and ammunition; that his men<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
were deserting; and that no more recruits came in. Colonel
Venner, one of his principal men, was at this juncture sent away
to Holland in order to get assistance in arms and money. And the
King's proclamation of pardon was carefully kept from the knowledge
of the soldiers.</p>

<p>On July the 4th the army returned to Bridgwater, and now Dr.
Hooke, chaplain to the army, and some of the officers were sent
away secretly in order to raise an insurrection in London and elsewhere;
the only hope being that risings in various parts would call
away some of the King's forces from the West. Some of the
Taunton men in the army rode from Bridgwater to see their friends.
But we women (who, for the most part, remained at home) learned
no news save that as yet there had been no signal victory: we did
not hear of the large desertions nor of the Duke's despondency.
Therefore, we continued in our fool's paradise and looked every
day for some great and crowning mercy. Those who are on the
side of the Lord are always expecting some special interference;
whereas, they ought to be satisfied with being on the right side,
whether victory or defeat be intended for them. In this enterprise
I doubt not that those godly men (there were, I dare say, some
godly men) who fell in battle, or were afterwards executed, received
their reward, and that a far, far greater reward than their conduct
deserved&mdash;for who can measure the short agony of death beside the
everlasting life of glory and joy unspeakable?</p>

<p>The last day of this fatal expedition was Sunday, the fifth day
of July: so that it took no more than three weeks in all between
its first beginning and its failure. Only three weeks! But how
much longer was it before the punishment and the expiation were
concluded? Nay, are they even yet concluded when thousands of
innocent women and children still go in poverty and mourning for
the loss of those who should have worked for them?</p>

<p>In the morning my father preached to the soldiers on the text
(Joshua xxii. 22), 'The Lord God of gods, the Lord God of gods,
He knoweth, and Israel he shall know; if it be in rebellion, or if in
transgression against the Lord, save us not this day.'</p>

<p>And now the time was come when the last battle was to be
fought.</p>

<p>The Earl of Feversham, who had been at Somerton, marched
this day across Sedgemoor and encamped at Weston Zoyland, which
is but five or six miles from Bridgwater.</p>

<p>Now it chanced that one William Sparke, of Chedzoy, hearing
of this advance, climbed the church tower, and, by aid of a spying-glass,
such as sailors use at sea, he discerned clearly the approach
of the army and its halt at Weston. Being a well-wisher to the
Duke, he sent one of his men, Richard Godfrey by name, with
orders to spy into and learn the position and numbers of the Earl's
army, and to carry his information straightway to Bridgwater.
This duty the fellow promised, and most faithfully performed.</p>

<p>The Duke had already learned the approach of Lord Feversham,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
and, being now wellnigh desperate with his continued losses,
and seeing his army gradually wasting away, with no fresh recruits,
he had resolved upon not waiting to be attacked, but on a retreat
northwards, hoping to get across the bridge at Keynsham, and so
march into Shropshire and Cheshire, where still he hoped to raise
another army. But (says he who hath helped me with this brief
account of the expedition) the retreat, which would have been
harassed by Lord Feversham's horse, would have turned into
flight; the men would have deserted in all directions; and when
the remains of the army arrived at Keynsham Bridge they would
certainly have found it occupied by the Duke of Beaufort.</p>

<p>The carriages were already loaded in readiness for this march;
it was to begin at nightfall; when the arrival of the man Godfrey,
and the news that he brought, caused the Duke to change everything.
For he now perceived that such a chance was offered him
as had never before occurred since his landing: viz., a night surprise,
and, if he were fortunate, the rout of the King's best troops.</p>

<p>It is said that had the Duke shown the same boldness in the
matter of Bristol that he showed in this night attack, he would
have gained that city first and his own cause next. Nor did it
appear at all a desperate attempt. For, though Lord Feversham
had 2,500 men with him, horse and foot, with sixteen field-pieces,
the Duke had nearly 3,000 foot (counting those armed with pikes
and scythes) and 600 horse with four field-pieces, and though the
King's troops included many companies of Grenadiers, with a
battalion of that famous regiment the Coldstream Guards, and
some hundred horse of the King's regiment and dragoons, the Duke
had with him at least 2,000 men well armed and resolute, as the
event showed. Besides this, he had the advantage of the surprise
and confusion of a night attack. And in addition, the camp was
not entrenched, the troopers had all gone to bed, the foot-soldiers
were drinking cider, and the officers were reported to be all drunk.</p>

<p>Therefore, it was resolved that the intended flight into Shropshire
should be abandoned, and that the whole matter should be
brought to an issue that very night.</p>

<p>Had the attack succeeded, all might yet have gone well with
the Duke. His enemies boasted that his raw country lads would
be routed at the first charge of regular soldiers; if he proved the
contrary, those who had deserted him would have returned; those
who held aloof would join. It was not the Cause which found men
lukewarm; it was the doubt&mdash;and nothing but the doubt&mdash;whether
the Duke's enterprise would be supported. And I never heard
that any found aught but commendation of the boldness and spirit
which brought us to the battle of Sedgemoor.</p>

<p>All that day we spent in quiet meditation, in prayer, in the
reading of the Bible, and in godly discourses, and herein I must
commend the modesty as well as the piety of Miss Susan Blake, in
that she invited my mother, as her elder and the wife of an eminent
minister, to conduct the religious exercises, though as the hostess<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
she might have demanded that privilege. We stirred not abroad
at all that day. The meeting-houses, which had been opened when
the Duke marched in, were now closed again.</p>

<p>In the evening, while we sat together discoursing upon the
special mercies vouchsafed to the people of the Lord, a strange
thing happened. Nay, I do not say that news may not have
reached Taunton already of the Duke's intentions, and of the position
of the King's forces. But this seems incredible, since it was
not known&mdash;except to the council by whom it was decided&mdash;till
late in the afternoon, and it was not to be thought that these would
hurry to spread the news abroad, and so ruin the whole affair. The
window being open, then, we could hear the voices of those who
talked in the street below. Now, there passed two men, and they
were talking as they went. Said one&mdash;and these were the words
we heard&mdash;</p>

<p>'I tell thee that the Duke will have no more to do than to lock
the stable doors, and so seize the troopers in their beds.'</p>

<p>We all started and listened. The voice below repeated&mdash;</p>

<p>'I say, Sir, and I have it first hand, that he hath but to lock
the stable doors and so seize all the troopers in their beds.'</p>

<p>Then they passed on their way.</p>

<p>Said my mother: 'My husband hath told me that not only may
the conscience be awakened by a word which seemeth chance, but
the future may be revealed by words which were perhaps meant in
another sense. What we have heard this evening may be a foretelling
of victory. My children, let us pray, and so to bed.'</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXII.</h2>

<h3>THE DAY AFTER THE FIGHT.</h3>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 254px;">
<img src="images/i_162.jpg" width="254" height="350" alt="It" />
</div>

<p>It was five o'clock when
I awoke next morning.
Though the hour was so
early, I heard a great
trampling and running
about the streets, and,
looking out of window, I
saw a concourse of the
townspeople gathered together,
listening to one who spoke to
them. But in the middle of
his speech they broke away
from him and ran to another
speaker, and so distractedly,
and with such gestures, that
they were clearly much moved
by some news, the nature of which I could
not guess. For in some faces there was
visible the outward show of triumph and
joy, and on others there lay plainly visible
the look of amazement or stupefaction;
and in the street I saw some women weeping
and crying. What had happened?
Oh! what had happened? Then, while I
was still dressing, there burst into the room Susan Blake, herself
but half dressed, her hair flying all abroad, the comb in her hand.</p>

<p>'Rejoice!' she cried. 'Oh! rejoice, and give thanks unto the
Lord! What did we hear last night? That the Duke had but to
shut the stable doors and seize the troopers in their beds. Look
out of window. See the people running and listening eagerly.
Oh! 'tis the crowning mercy that we have looked for: the Lord
hath blown and His enemies are scattered. Remember the strange
words we heard last night. What said the unknown man?&mdash;nay,
he said it twice: "The Duke had but to lock the stable doors."
Nay, and yesterday I saw, and last night I heard, the screech-owl<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
thrice&mdash;which was meant for the ruin of our enemies. Oh! Alice,
Alice, this is a joyful day!'</p>

<p>'But look,' I said, 'they have a downcast look; they run about
as if distracted, and some are wringing their hands&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>''Tis with excess of joy,' she replied, looking out of the window
with me, though her hair was flying in the wind. 'They are so
surprised and so rejoiced that they cannot speak or move.'</p>

<p>'But there are women weeping and wailing; why do they
weep?'</p>

<p>'It is for those who are killed. Needs must in every great
victory that some are killed&mdash;poor brave fellows!&mdash;and some are
wounded. Nay, my dear, thou hast three at least at the camp,
who are dear to thee; and God knows I have many. Let us pray
that we do not have to weep like those poor women.'</p>

<p>She was so earnest in her looks and words, and I myself so
willing to believe, that I doubted no longer.</p>

<p>'Listen! oh! listen!' she cried; 'never, never before have
bells rung a music so joyful to my heart.'</p>

<p>For now the bells of the great tower of St. Mary's began to
ring. Clash, clash, clash, all together, as if they were cracking
their throats with joy, and at the sound of the bells those men in
the street, who seemed to me stupefied as by a heavy blow, put up
their hands to their ears and fled as if they could not bear the
noise, and the women who wept wrung their hands, and shrieked
aloud in anguish, as if the joy of the chimes mocked the sorrow of
their hearts.</p>

<p>'Poor creatures!' said Susan. 'From my heart I pity them.
But the victory is ours, and now it only remains to offer up our
humble prayers and praises to the Throne of all mercy.'</p>

<p>So we knelt and thanked God.</p>

<p>'O Lord! we thank and bless Thee! O Lord! we thank and
bless Thee!' cried Susan, the tears of joy and gratitude running
down her cheeks.</p>

<p>Outside, the noise of hurrying feet and voices increased, and
more women shrieked, and still the joy-bells clashed and clanged.</p>

<p>'O Lord! we thank Thee! O Lord! we bless Thee!' Susan
repeated on her knees, her voice broken with her joy and triumph.
'Twas all that she could say.</p>

<p>I declare that at that moment I had no more doubt of the victory
than I had of the sunshine. There could be no doubt. The
joy-bells were ringing: how should we know that the Rev. Mr.
Harte, the Vicar, caused them to be rung, and not our friends?
There could be no manner of doubt. The people running to and
fro in the street had heard the news, and were rushing to tell each
other and to hear more&mdash;the women who wept were mothers or
wives of the slain. Again, we had encouraged each other with
assurances of our success, so that we were already fully prepared
to believe that it had come. Had we not seen a splendid army,
seven thousand strong, march out of Taunton town, led by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
bravest man and most accomplished soldier in the English nation?
Was not the army on the Lord's side? Were we not in a Protestant
country? Were not the very regiments of the King Protestants?
Why go on? And yet&mdash;oh! sad to think!&mdash;even while
we knelt and prayed, the army was scattered like a cloud of
summer gnats by a shower and a breeze, and hundreds lay dead
upon the field, and a thousand men were prisoners; and many
were already hanging in gemmaces upon the gibbets, where they
remained till King William's coming suffered them to be taken
down; and the rest were flying in every direction hoping to
escape.</p>

<p>'O Lord! we thank Thee! O Lord! we bless Thee!'</p>

<p>While thus we prayed we heard the door below burst open, and
a trampling of a man's boots; and Susan, hastily rolling up her hair,
ran downstairs, followed by mother and myself.</p>

<p>There stood Barnaby. Thank God! one of our lads was safe
out of the fight. His face and hands were black with powder;
his red coat, which had been so fine, was now smirched with mud
and stained with I know not what&mdash;marks of weather, of dust,
and of gunpowder; the right-hand side was torn away; he
had no hat upon his head, and a bloody clout was tied about his
forehead.</p>

<p>'Barnaby!' I cried.</p>

<p>'Captain Barnaby!' cried Susan, clasping her hands.</p>

<p>'My son!' cried mother. 'Oh! thou art wounded! Quick,
Alice, child&mdash;a basin of water, quick!'</p>

<p>'Nay&mdash;'tis but a scratch,' he said; 'and there is no time for
nursing.'</p>

<p>'When&mdash;where&mdash;how?' we all cried together, 'was the victory
won? Is the enemy cut to pieces? Is the war finished?'</p>

<p>'Victory?' he repeated, in his slow way&mdash;'what victory?
Give me a drink of cider, and if there is a morsel of victual in the
house&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>I hurried to bring him both cold meat and bread and a cup full
of cider. He began to eat and drink.</p>

<p>'Why,' he said, talking between his mouthfuls, 'if the worst
comes 'tis better to face it with a&mdash;&mdash;Your health, Madam': he
finished the cider. 'Another cup, Sister, if you love me: I have
neither eaten nor drunk since yesterday at seven o'clock, or thereabouts.'
He said no more until he had cleared the dish of the
gammon and left nothing but the bone. This he dropped into his
pocket. 'When the provisions are out,' he said wisely, 'there is
good gnawing in the shankbone of a ham.' Then he drank up the
rest of the cider and looked around. 'Victory? Did someone
speak of victory?'</p>

<p>'Yes&mdash;where was it? Tell us quick!'</p>

<p>'Well, there was in some sort a victory. But the King
had it.'</p>

<p>'What mean you, Barnaby? The King had it?&mdash;what King?'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span></p>

<p>'Not King Monmouth. That King is riding away to find some
port and get some ship, I take it, which will carry him back to
Holland.'</p>

<p>'Barnaby, what is it? Oh! what is it? Tell us all.'</p>

<p>'All there is to tell, Sister, is that our army is clean cut to
pieces, and that those who are not killed or prisoners are making
off with what speed they may. As for me, I should have thrown
away my coat and picked up some old duds and got off to Bristol
and so aboard ship and away, but for Dad.'</p>

<p>'Barnaby,' cried my mother, 'what hath happened to him?
Where is he?'</p>

<p>'I said, mother,' he replied very slowly, and looking in her
face strangely, 'that I would look after him, didn't I? Well,
when we marched out of Bridgwater at nightfall nothing would
serve but he must go too. I think he compared himself with
Moses who stood afar off and held up his arms. Never was there
any man more eager to get at the enemy than Dad. If he had not
been a minister, what a soldier he would have made!'</p>

<p>'Go on&mdash;quick, Barnaby.'</p>

<p>'I can go, Sister, no quicker than I can. That is quite sure.'</p>

<p>'Where is he, my son?' asked my mother.</p>

<p>Barnaby jerked his thumb over his left shoulder.</p>

<p>'He is over there, and he is safe enough for the present.
Well, after the battle was over, and it was no use going on any
longer, Monmouth and Lord Grey having already run away&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Run away? Run away?'</p>

<p>'Run away, Sister. Aboard ship the Captain stands by the
crew to the last, and, if they strike, he is prisoner with them.
Ashore, the General runs away and leaves his men to find out
when they will give over fighting. We fought until there was no
more ammunition, and then we ran with the rest. Now, I had
not gone far before I saw lying on the moor at my very feet the
poor old Dad.'</p>

<p>'Oh!'</p>

<p>'He was quite pale, and I thought he was dead. So I was
about to leave him when he opened his eyes. "What cheer,
Dad?" He said nothing; so I felt his pulse and found him breathing.
"But what cheer, Dad?" I asked him again. "Get up if
thou canst, and come with me." He looked as if he understood
me not, and he shut his eyes again. Now, when you run away,
the best thing is to run as fast and to run as far as you can. Yet
I could not run with Dad lying in the road half dead. So while I
tried to think what to do, because the murdering Dragoons were
cutting us down in all directions, there came galloping past a pony
harnessed to a kind of go-cart, where, I suppose, there had been a
barrel or two of cider for the soldiers. The creature was mad with
the noise of the guns, and I had much ado to catch him and hold
the reins while I lifted Dad into the cart. When I had done that,
I ran by the side of the horse and drove him off the road across<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
the moor, which was rough going, but for dear life one must endure
much, to North Marton, where I struck the road to Taunton, and
brought him safe, so far.'</p>

<p>'Take me to him, Barnaby,' said my mother. 'Take me to
him.'</p>

<p>'Why, mother,' he said kindly, 'I know not if 'tis wise. For,
look you&mdash;if they catch us, me they will hang or shoot, though
Dad they may let go, for he is sped already&mdash;and for a tender heart
like thine 'twould be a piteous sight to see thy son hanging from a
branch with a tight rope round his neck and thy husband dead on
a hand-cart.'</p>

<p>'Barnaby, take me to him!&mdash;take me to him!'</p>

<p>'Oh! Is it true? Is it true? Oh! Captain Barnaby, is it
really true? Then, why are the bells a-ringing?'</p>

<p>Clash! Clash! Clash! The bells rang out louder and louder.
One would have thought the whole town was rejoicing. Yet there
were a thousand lads in the army belonging to Taunton town
alone, and I know not how many ever came home again.</p>

<p>'They are ringing,' said Barnaby, 'because King Monmouth's
army is scattered and the rebellion is all over. Well: we have
had our chance and we are undone. Now must we sing small
again. Madam,' he said earnestly, addressing Susan, 'if I remember
right, they were your hands that carried the naked sword and
the Bible?'</p>

<p>'Sir, they were my hands. I am proud of that day.'</p>

<p>'And they were your scholars who worked the flags and gave
them to the Duke that day when you walked in a procession?'</p>

<p>'They were my scholars,' she said proudly.</p>

<p>'Then, Madam, seeing that we have, if all reports be true, a
damned unforgiving kind of King, my advice to you is to follow
my example and run. Hoist all sail, Madam, and fly to some port&mdash;any
port. Fly false colours. When hanging, flogging, branding,
and the like amusements set in, I think they will remember the
Maids of Taunton. That is my advice, Madam.'</p>

<p>'Sir,' said Susan bravely, though her cheek grew pale when he
spoke of floggings and brandings, 'I thank you. Whither should
I fly? Needs must I stay here and bear whatever affliction the
Lord may lay upon me. And, since our Protestant hero is defeated,
methinks it matters little what becomes of any of us.'</p>

<p>'Why,' Barnaby shook his head, 'King Monmouth is defeated,
that is most true; but we who survive have got ourselves to look
after. Sister, get a basket and put into it provisions.'</p>

<p>'What will you have, Barnaby?'</p>

<p>'Everything that you can find. Cold bacon for choice, and
bread, and a bottle of drink if you have any, and&mdash;all you can lay
hands upon. With your good leave, Madam.'</p>

<p>'Oh! Sir, take all&mdash;take all. I would to God that everything
I have in the world could be used for the succour of these my
friends!' And with that she began to weep and to cry.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span></p>

<p>I filled a great basket with all that there was in the house, and
he took it upon his arm. And then we went away with many
tears and fond farewells from this kind soul who had done so much
for the Cause, and was now about to pay so heavy a penalty for
her zeal.</p>

<p>Outside in the street the people recognised Barnaby for one of
Monmouth's Captains, and pressed round him and asked him a
thousand questions, but he answered shortly.</p>

<p>'We were drubbed, I tell you. King Monmouth hath run
away. We have all run away. How should I know how many
are killed? Every man who doth not wish to be hanged had best
run away and hide. The game is up&mdash;friend, we are sped. What
more can I say? How do I know, in the Devil's name, whose
fault it was? How can I tell, Madam, if your son is safe? If he
is safe, make him creep into a hiding-place'&mdash;and so on to a hundred
who crowded after him and questioned him as to the nature
and meaning of the defeat. Seeing that no more news could be
got from him, the people left off following us, and we got out of
the town on the east side, where the road leads to Ilminster; but
it is a bad road and little frequented.</p>

<p>Here Barnaby looked about him carefully to make sure that no
one was observing us, and then, finding that no one was within
sight, he turned to the right down a grassy lane between hedges.</p>

<p>''Tis this way that I brought him,' he said. 'Poor old Dad! he
can now move neither hand nor foot; and his legs will no more be
any use to him. Yet he seemed in no pain, though the jolting of
the cart must have shaken him more than a bit.'</p>

<p>The lane led into a field, and that field into another and a
smaller one, with a plantation of larches on two sides and a brook
shaded with alders on a third side. In one corner was a linney,
with a thatched roof supported on wooden pillars in front and
closed in at back and sides. It was such a meadow as is used for
the pasture of cattle and the keeping of a bull.</p>

<p>At the entrance of this meadow Barnaby stopped and looked
about him with approbation.</p>

<p>'Here,' he said slowly, 'is a hiding-place fit for King Monmouth
himself. A road unfrequented; the rustics all gone off to the wars&mdash;though
now, I doubt not, having had their bellyfull of fighting.
I suppose there were once cattle in the meadow, but they are either
driven away by the clubmen for safety, or they have been stolen
by the gipsies. No troopers will this day come prying along this
road, or if they do search the wood, which is unlikely, they will
not look in the linney; here can we be snug until we make up our
minds what course is best.'</p>

<p>'Barnaby,' I said, 'take us to my father without more speech.'</p>

<p>'I have laid him,' he went on, 'upon the bare ground in the
linney; but it is soft and dry lying, and the air is warm, though
last night it rained and was cold. He looks happy, mother, and I
doubt if he hath any feeling left in his limbs. Once I saw a man<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
shot in the backbone and never move afterwards, but he lived for
a bit. Here he is.'</p>

<p>Alas! lying motionless on his back, his head bare, his white
hair lying over his face, his eyes closed, his cheek white, and no
sign of life in him except that his breast gently heaved, was my
father. Then certain words which he had uttered came back to
my memory. 'What matters the end,' were the words he said, 'if
I have freedom of speech for a single day?'</p>

<p>He had enjoyed that freedom for three weeks.</p>

<p>My mother threw herself on her knees beside him and raised
his head.</p>

<p>'Ah! my heart,' she cried, 'my dear heart, my husband, have
they killed thee? Speak, my dear&mdash;speak if thou canst! Art
thou in pain? Can we do aught to relieve thee? Oh! is this the
end of all?'</p>

<p>But my father made no reply. He opened his eyes, but they
did not move: he looked straight before him, but he saw nothing.</p>

<p>And this, until the end, was the burden of all. He spoke no
word to show that he knew anyone, or that he was in pain, or that
he desired anything. He neither ate nor drank, yet for many
weeks longer he continued to live.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIII.</h2>

<h3>IN HIDING.</h3>


<div class="drop">
<img src="images/i_169.jpg" alt="T" width="100" height="100" class="cap" />
 <p class="cap_1">Thus we began our miserable flight. Thus, in silence,
we sat in the shade of the linney all the morning.
Outside, the blackbird warbled in the wood and the
lark sang in the sky. But we sat in silence, not
daring so much as to ask each other if those things
were real or if we were dreaming a dreadful dream.
Still and motionless lay my father's body, as if the body of a dead
man. He felt no pain&mdash;of that I am assured; it makes me sick
even to think that he might have suffered pain from his wound;
he had no sense at all of what was going on. Yet once or twice,
during the long trance or paralysis into which he had fallen, he
opened his lips as if to speak. And he breathed gently&mdash;so that
he was not dead. Barnaby, for his part, threw himself upon his
face, and, laying his head upon his arm, fell asleep instantly. The
place was very quiet; at the end of the meadow was a brook, and
there was a wood upon the other side; we could hear the prattling
of the water over the pebbles; outside the linney, a great elm-tree
stretched out its branches; presently I saw a squirrel sitting upon
one and peering curiously at us, not at all afraid, so still and
motionless we were. I remember that I envied the squirrel. He
took no thought even for his daily bread. He went not forth to
fight. And the hedge-sparrows, no more afraid than if the linney
was empty, hopped into the place and began picking about among
the straw. And so the hours slowly passed away, and by degrees
I began to understand a little better what had happened to us, for
at the first shock one could not perceive the extent of the disaster,
and we were as in a dream when we followed Barnaby out of the
town. The great and splendid army was destroyed; that gallant
hero, the Duke, was in flight; those of the soldiers who were not
killed or taken prisoners were running hither and thither trying to
escape; my father was wounded, stricken to death, as it seemed,
and deprived of power to move, to feel, or to think. While I considered
this, I remembered again how he had turned his eyes from
gazing into the sky, and asked me what it mattered even if the
end would be death to him and ruin unto all of us. And I do
firmly believe that at that moment he had an actual vision of the end,
and really saw before his eyes the very things that were to come
to pass, and that he knew all along what the end would be. Yet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
he had delivered his soul&mdash;why, then he had obtained his prayer&mdash;and
by daily exhortation had doubtless done much to keep up the
spirit of those in the army who were sober and godly men. Did
he also, like Sir Christopher, have another vision which should
console and encourage him? Did he see the time to follow when a
greater than the Duke should come and bring with him the deliverance
of the country? There are certain gracious words with which
that vision closes (the last which he did expound to us), the vision,
I mean, of the Basket of Summer Fruit. Did those words ring in
his mind and comfort him even in the prospect of his own end?
Then my thoughts, which were swift and yet beyond my control,
left him and considered the case of Barnaby. He had been a
Captain in the Green Regiment; he would be hanged, for certain,
if he were caught. My sweetheart, my Robin, had also been a
Captain in the Duke's army. All the Duke's officers would be
hanged if they were caught. But perhaps Robin was already dead&mdash;dead
on the battlefield&mdash;his face white, his hands stiff, blood
upon him somewhere, and a cruel wound upon his dear body! Oh,
Robin! Yet I shed no tears. Humphrey, who had been one of
the Duke's chyrurgeons, he would also be surely hanged if he were
caught. Why&mdash;since all would be hanged&mdash;why not hang mother
and me as well, and so an end!</p>
</div>

<p>About noon Barnaby began to stir; then he grunted and went
to sleep again: presently he moved once more, then he rolled over
on his broad back and went to sleep again. It was not until the
sun was quite low that he awoke, sitting up suddenly, and looking
about him with quick suspicion, as one who hath been sleeping in
the country of an enemy, or where wild beasts are found.</p>

<p>Then he sprang to his feet and shook himself like a dog.</p>

<p>'Sister,' he said, 'thou shouldst have awakened me earlier. I
have slept all the day. Well, we are safe, so far.' Here he looked
cautiously out of the linney towards the wood and the road. 'So
far, I say, we are safe. I take it we had best not wait until
to-morrow, but budge to-night. For not only will the troopers
scour the country, but they will offer rewards; and the gipsies&mdash;ay,
and even the country-folk&mdash;will hasten to give information out of
their greedy hearts. We must budge this very night.'</p>

<p>'Whither shall we go, Barnaby?'</p>

<p>He went on as if he had not heard my question.</p>

<p>'We shall certainly be safe here for to-night; but for to-morrow
I doubt. Best not run the chance. For to-day their hands are full:
they will be hanging the prisoners. Some they will hang first and
try afterwards, some they will try first and hang afterwards. What
odds if they are to be hanged in the end? The cider orchards never
had such fruit as they will show this autumn, if the King prove
revengeful&mdash;as, to judge by his sour face, he will be.'</p>

<p>Here he cursed the King, his sour face, his works and ways, his
past, his present, and his future, in round language, which I hope
his wounded father did not hear.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span></p>

<p>'We must lie snug for a month or two somewhere, until the
unlucky Monmouth men will be suffered to return home in peace.
Ay! 'twill be a month and more, I take it, before the country will
be left quiet. A month and more&mdash;and Dad not able to crawl!'</p>

<p>'Where shall we lie snug, Barnaby?'</p>

<p>'That, Sister, is what I am trying to find out. How to lie snug
with a couple of women and a wounded man who cannot move?
'Twas madness of the poor old Dad to bring thee to the camp, Child.
For now we cannot&mdash;any of us&mdash;part company, and if we stay
together 'twill maybe bring our necks to the halter.'</p>

<p>'Leave us, Barnaby,' I said. 'Oh! leave us to do what we
can for the poor sufferer, and save thyself.'</p>

<p>'Ta, ta, ta, Sister&mdash;knowest not what thou sayest. Let me
consider. There may be some way of safety. As for provisions,
now: we have the basket full&mdash;enough for two days say&mdash;what the
plague did Dad, the poor old man, want with women when fighting
was on hand? When the fighting is done, I grant you, women,
with the tobacco and punch, are much in place. Those are pretty
songs, now, that I used to sing about women and drink.'</p>

<p>'Barnaby, is this a time to be talking of such things as drink
and singing?'</p>

<p>'All times are good. Nevertheless, all company is not fitting.
Wherefore, Sis, I say no more.'</p>

<p>'Barnaby, knowest thou aught of Robin? Or of Humphrey?'</p>

<p>'I know nothing. They may be dead; they may be wounded
and prisoners; much I fear, knowing the spirit of the lads, that
both are killed. Nay, I saw Humphrey before the fight, and he
spoke to me&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'What did Humphrey say?'</p>

<p>'I asked why he hung his head and looked so glum, seeing that
we were at last going forth to meet the King's army. This I said
because I knew Humphrey to be a lad of mettle, though his arm is
thin and his body is crooked. "I go heavy, Barnaby," he said,
speaking low lest others should hear, "because I see plainly that,
unless some signal success come to us, this our business will end
badly." Then he began to talk about the thousands who were to have
been raised all over the country; how he himself had brought to
the Duke promises of support gathered all the way from London to
Bradford Orcas, and how his friends in Holland even promised both
men and arms; but none of these promises had been kept; how
Dad had brought promises of support from all the Nonconformists
of the West, but hardly any, save at Taunton, had come forward;
and how the army was melting away, and no more recruits coming
in. And then he said that he had been the means of bringing so
many to the Duke that if they died their deaths would lie upon his
conscience. And he spoke lovingly of Robin and of thee, Sister.
And so we parted, and I saw him no more. As for what he said, I
minded it not a straw. Many a croaker turns out in the long run to
be brave in the fight. Doubtless he is dead; and Robin, too. Both<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
are dead. I take it, Sis, thou hast lost thy sweetheart. Cry a
little, my dear,' he added kindly; ''twill ease the pain at thy
heart. 'Tis natural for a woman to cry.'</p>

<p>'I cannot cry, Barnaby: I wish I could. The tears rise to my
eyes, but my throat is dry.'</p>

<p>'Try a prayer or two, Sister. 'Twas wont to comfort the heart
of my mother when she was in trouble.'</p>

<p>'A prayer? Brother, I have done nothing but pray since this
unfortunate rebellion began. A prayer? Oh, I cannot pray! If
I were to pray now it would be as if my words were echoed back
from a wall of solid rock. We were praying all yesterday; we
made the Sabbath into a day of prayer without ceasing; and this
morning, when you opened the door, we were praising and thanking
God for the mercy of the great victory bestowed upon us. And
at that time the poor brave men&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'They were brave enough to the end,' said Barnaby.</p>

<p>'The poor brave men lying cold and dead upon the field (among
them, maybe, Robin!), and the prisoners huddled together somewhere,
and men hanging already upon the gibbets. We were
praising God&mdash;and my father lying on the ground stricken to
death, and thou a fugitive, and all of us ruined! Prayer? How
could I pray from such a pit of woe?'</p>

<p>'Child'&mdash;my mother lifted her pale face&mdash;'in the darkest
hour pray without ceasing. Even if there happen a darker hour
than this, in everything, by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving,
let your requests be made known&mdash;with thanksgiving, my
daughter.'</p>

<p>Alas! I could not obey the apostolic order. 'Twas too much for
me. So we fell into silence. When the sun had quite gone down
Barnaby went forth cautiously. Presently he came back.</p>

<p>'There is no one on the road,' he said. 'We may now go on
our way. The air of Taunton is dangerous to us. It breeds swift
and fatal diseases. I have now resolved what to do. I will lift
my father upon the cart again and put in the pony. Four or five
miles sou'-west or thereabouts is Black Down, which is a No-Man's-Land.
Thither will we go and hide in the combs, where no one
ever comes, except the gipsies.'</p>

<p>'How shall we live Barnaby?'</p>

<p>'That,' he said, 'we shall find out when we come to look about
us. There is provision for two days. The nights are warm.
We shall find cover or make it with branches. There is water in
the brooks and dry wood to burn. There we may, perhaps, be
safe. When the country is quiet, we will make our way across the
hills to Bradford Orcas, where no one will molest you, and I can go
off to Bristol or Lyme, or wherever there are ships to be found.
When sailors are shipwrecked, they do not begin by asking what
they shall do on dry land: they ask only to feel the stones beneath
their feet. We must think of nothing now but of a place of
safety.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span></p>

<p>'Barnaby, are the open hills a proper place for a wounded
man?'</p>

<p>'Why, Child, for a choice between the hills and what else may
happen if we stay here, give me the hills, even for a wounded man.
But, indeed'&mdash;he whispered, so that my mother should not hear
him&mdash;'he will die. Death is written on his face. I know not how
long he will live. But he must die. Never did any man recover
from such evil plight.'</p>

<p>He harnessed the pony to the cart, which was little more than
a couple of planks laid side by side, and laid father upon them, just
as he had brought him from Taunton. My mother made a kind of
pillow for him, with grass tied up in her kerchief, and so we hoped
that he would not feel the jogging of the cart.</p>

<p>'The stream,' said Barnaby, 'comes down from the hills. Let
us follow its course upwards.'</p>

<p>It was a broad stream with a shallow bed, for the most part flat
and pebbly, and on either side of the stream lay a strip of soft
turf, broad enough for the cart to run upon. So that, as long as
that lasted, we had very easy going, my mother and I walking one
on each side, so as to steady the pillow and keep the poor head
upon it from pain. But whether we went easy, or whether we
went rough, that head made no sign of feeling aught, and lay, just
as in the linney, as if dead.</p>

<p>I cannot tell how long we went on beside that stream. 'Twas
in a wild, uncultivated country; the ground ascended; the stream
became narrower and swifter; presently the friendly strip of turf
failed altogether, and then we had trouble to keep the cart from
upsetting. I went to the pony's head, and Barnaby, going behind
the cart, lifted it over the rough places, and sometimes carried his
end of it. The night was chilly; my feet were wet with splashing
in the brook, and I was growing faint with hunger, when Barnaby
called a halt.</p>

<p>'We are now,' he said, 'at the head of the stream. In half an
hour, or thereabouts, it will be break of day. Let us rest. Mother,
you must eat something. Come, sister, 'tis late for supper, and
full early for breakfast. Take some meat and bread and half a
cup of cider.'</p>

<p>It is all I remember of that night.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIV.</h2>

<h3>THE CAMP IN THE COMB.</h3>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 258px;">
<img src="images/i_174.jpg" width="258" height="350" alt="Our" />
</div>

<p>Our camping-place, when I
awoke in the morning, I
found to be near the head
of a most beautiful comb
or valley among the Black
Down Hills. I knew it
not at the time, but it was
not far from that old
Roman stronghold which
we had passed on our way
to Taunton, called Castle
Ratch. The hills on the
Somerset side are of a
gentle or gradual slope,
and the valley was not
deep, but yet, where we
lay, so grown over with
trees as to afford a complete
shelter and hiding-place,
while at our feet the
brook took its rise in a
green quagmire and began
to make its way downwards
among ferns and bushes, and through a wild,
uncultivated country, beyond which the farms and fields began.
The birds were singing, the sun was already high, and the air was
warm, though there was a fresh breeze blowing. The warmth and
sweetness filled my soul when I awoke, and I sat up with joy,
until suddenly I remembered why we were here, and who were
here with me. Then my heart sank like a lump of lead in water.
I looked around. My father lay just as he had been lying all the
day before, motionless, white of cheek, and as one dead, save for
the slight motion of his chest and the twitching of his nostril. As
I looked at him in the clear morning light, it was borne in upon
me very strongly that he was indeed dead, inasmuch as his soul
seemed to have fled. He saw nothing, he felt nothing. If the
flies crawled over his eyelids he made no sign of disturbance; yet
he breathed, and from time to time he murmured&mdash;but as one that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
dreameth. Beside him lay my mother sleeping, worn out by the
fatigues of the night. Barnaby had spread his coat to cover her so
that she should not take cold, and he had piled a little heap of dead
leaves to make her a pillow. He was lying at her feet, head on
arm, sleeping heavily. What should be done, I wondered, when
next he woke?</p>

<p>First I went down the comb a little way till the stream was
deep enough, and there I bathed my feet, which were swollen and
bruised by the long walk up the comb. Though it was in the
midst of so much misery there was a pleasure of dabbling my feet
in the cool water and afterwards of walking about barefoot in the
grass. I disturbed an adder which was sleeping on a flat stone in
the sun, and it lifted its venomous head and hissed, but did not
spring upon me. Then I washed my face and hands and made my
hair as smooth as without a comb it was possible. When I had
done this I remembered that perhaps my father might be thirsty or
at least able to drink, though he seemed no more to feel hunger
or thirst. So I filled the tin pannikin&mdash;it was Barnaby's&mdash;with
water and tried to pour a little into his mouth. He seemed to
swallow it, and I gave him a little more until he would swallow no
more. Observe that he took no other nourishment than a little
water, wine, or milk, or a few drops of broth until the end. So I
covered his face with a handkerchief to keep off the flies, and left
him. Then I looked into the basket. All that there was in it would not
be more than enough for Barnaby's breakfast, unless his appetite
should fail him by reason of fear; though, in truth, he had no fear
being captured, or of anything else. There was in it a piece of
bacon, a large loaf of bread, a lump of cheese, a bottle of cider;
nothing more. When these provisions were gone, what next?
Could we venture into the nearest village and buy food, or to the
first farm-house? Then we might fall straight into the jaws of the
enemy, who were probably running over the whole country in
search of the fugitives. Could we buy without money? Could we
beg without arousing suspicions? If the people were well-inclined
to the Protestant cause we might trust them. But how could we
tell that? So in my mind I turned over everything except the one
thing which might have proved our salvation, and that you shall
hear directly. Also, which was a very strange thing, I quite forgot
that I had upon me, tied by a string round my waist and well concealed,
Barnaby's bag of gold&mdash;two hundred and fifty pieces.
Thus there was money enough and to spare. I discovered, next,
that our pony had run away in the night. The cart was there, but
no pony to drag it. Well, it was not much; but it seemed an
additional burden to bear. I ventured a little way up the valley,
following a sheep-track which mounted higher and higher. I saw
no sign anywhere of man's presence; that, I take it, is marked in
woods by circles of burnt cinders, by trees felled, by bundles of
broom or fern tied up, or by shepherds' huts. Here there was
nothing at all; you would have said that the place had never been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
visited by man. Presently I came to a place where the woods
ceased, the last of the trees being much stunted and blown over
from the west; and then the top of the hill began, not a sharp
pico or point, but a great open plain, flat, or swelling out here and
there with many of the little hillocks which people say are ancient
tombs. And no trees at all, but only bare turf, so that one could
see a great way off. But there was no sign of man anywhere: no
smoke in the comb at my feet; no shepherd on the hill. At this
juncture of our fortunes any stranger might be an enemy; therefore
I returned, but so far well pleased.</p>

<p>Barnaby was now awake, and was inspecting the basket of provisions.</p>

<p>'Sister,' he said, 'we must go upon half rations for breakfast;
but I hope, unless my skill fails, to bring you something better for
supper. The bread you shall have, and mother. The bacon may
keep till to-morrow. The cider you had better keep against such
times as you feel worn out and want a cordial, though a glass of
Nantz were better, if Nantz grew in the woods.' He looked around
as if to see whether a miracle would not provide him with a flask of
strong drink, but, seeing none, shook his head.</p>

<p>'As for me,' he went on, 'I am a sailor, and I understand how
to forage. Therefore, yesterday, foreseeing that the provisions
might give out, I dropped the shank of the ham into my pocket.
Now you shall see.'</p>

<p>He produced this delicate morsel, and, sitting down, began to
gnaw and to bite into the bone with his strong teeth, exactly like
a dog. This he continued, with every sign of satisfaction, for a
quarter of an hour or so, when he desisted, and replaced the bone in
his pocket.</p>

<p>'We throw away the bones,' he said. 'The dogs gnaw them
and devour them. Think you that it is for their amusement? Not
so; but for the juices and the nourishment that are in and around
the bone; for the marrow and for the meat that still will stick in
odd corners.' He went down to the stream with the pannikin and
drank a cup or two of water to finish what they called a horse's
meal&mdash;namely, the food first and the water afterwards.</p>

<p>'And now,' he added, 'I have breakfasted. It is true that I
am still hungry, but I have eaten enough to carry me on for a while.
Many a poor lad cast away on a desert shore would find a shank of
a ham a meal fit for a king; aye, and a meal or two after that. I
shall make a dinner presently off this bone; and I shall still keep
it against a time when there may be no provision left.'</p>

<p>Then he looked about him, shading his eyes with his hand.
'Let us consider,' he said. 'The troopers, I take it, are riding
along the roads. Whether they will ride over these hills, I know
not; but I think they will not, because their horses cannot well
get up these combs. Certainly, if they do, it will not be by the
way we came. We are here, therefore, hidden away snug. Why
should we budge? Nowhere is there a more deserted part of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
country than Black Down, on whose side we are. And I do not
think, further, that we should find anywhere a safer place to hide
ourselves in than this comb, where, I dare to say, no one comes, unless
it be the gipsies or the broom-squires, all the year round. And
now they are all laden with the spoil of the army&mdash;for, after a
battle, this gentry swoop down upon the field like the great birds
which I have seen abroad upon the carcases of drowned beasts, and
plunder the dead. Next they must go into town in order to sell
their booty; then they will be fain to drink about till all is spent;
so they will leave us undisturbed. Therefore, we will stay here,
Sister. First, I will go and try the old tricks by which I did often
in the old time improve the fare at home. Next, I will devise some
way of making a more comfortable resting-place. Thank the Lord
for fine weather, so far.'</p>

<p>He was gone a couple of hours. During that time my mother
awoke. Her mind was broken by the suddenness of this trouble,
and she cared no more to speak, sitting still by the side of her
husband, and watching for any change in him. But I persuaded
her to take a little bread and a cup of cider.</p>

<p>When Barnaby came back, he brought with him a blackbird, a
thrush, and two wood-pigeons. He had not forgotten the tricks of
his boyhood, when he would often bring home a rabbit, a hare, or
a basket of trout. So that my chief terror, that we might be forced
to abandon our hiding-place through sheer hunger, was removed.
But Barnaby was full of all kinds of devices.</p>

<p>He then set to work with his great knife, cutting down a
quantity of green branches, which he laid out side by side, with
their leaves on, and then bound them together, cleverly interlacing
the smaller shoots and branches with each other, so that he made a
long kind of hurdle, about six feet high. This, which by reason of
the leaves was almost impervious to the wind, he disposed round
the trunks of three young trees growing near each other. Thus he
made a small three-cornered inclosure. Again, he cut other and
thicker branches, and laid them over and across this hurdle, and
cut turf which he placed upon the branches, so that here was now
a hut with a roof and walls complete. Said I not that Barnaby
was full of devices?</p>

<p>'There,' he said, when all was ready, 'is a house for you. It
will have to rain hard and long before the water begins to drop
through the branches which make the roof and the slabs of turf.
Well, 'tis a shelter. Not so comfortable as the old cottage, perhaps,
but nearly as commodious. If it is not a palace, it will serve us to
keep off the sun by day and the dew by night.'</p>

<p>Next he gathered a great quantity of dry fern, dead leaves, and
heather, and these he disposed within the hut, so that they made a
thick and warm carpet or covering. Nay, at night they even formed
a covering for the feet and prevented one from feeling cold. When
all was done, he lifted my father gently and laid him with great
tenderness upon this carpet within the rude shelter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span></p>

<p>'This shall be a warmer night for thee than the last, Dad,' he
said. 'There shall be no jolting of thy poor bones. What, mother?
We can live here till the cold weather comes. The wind will perhaps
blow a bit through the leaves to-night, but not much, and
to-morrow I will see to that. Be easy in your mind about the
provisions'&mdash;Alas! my poor mother was thinking of anything in
the world except the provisions&mdash;'There are rabbits and birds in
plenty; we can catch them and eat them; bread we must do without
when what we have is gone, and as for strong drink and tobacco'&mdash;he
sighed heavily&mdash;'they will come again when better times are
served out.'</p>

<p>In these labours I helped as much as I was able, and particularly
in twisting the branches together. And thus the whole day passed,
not tediously, and without any alarms, the labour being cheered by
the hopefulness of Barnaby's honest face. No one, to look at that
face, could believe that he was flying for his life, and would be
hanged if he was caught. After sunset we lit a fire, but a small one
only, and well hidden by the woods, so that its light might not be
seen from below. Then Barnaby dexterously plucked and trussed
the birds and roasted them in the embers, so that had my heart
been at rest I should have had a most delicious supper. And I
confess that I did begin to pluck up a little courage, and to hope
that we might yet escape, and that Robin might be living. After
supper my mother prayed, and I could join with more of resignation
and something of faith. Alas! in times of trial how easily
doth the Christian fall from faith! The day before, prayer seemed
to me a mockery; it was as if all prayer were addressed to a deaf
God, or to one who will not hear; for our prayers had all been for
safety and victory, and we were suddenly answered with disaster
and defeat.</p>

<p>After supper, Barnaby sat beside the embers and began to talk
in a low voice.</p>

<p>''Twill be a sorrowful barley-mow song this year,' he said; 'a
dozen brave lads from Bradford alone will be dead.'</p>

<p>'Not all dead, Barnaby! Oh! not all!'</p>

<p>'I know not. Some are prisoners, some are dead, some are
running away.' Then he began to sing in a low voice,</p>

<p class="center">
'Here's a health to the barley-mow&mdash;<br />
</p>

<p>I remember, Sister, when I would run a mile to hear that song,
though my father flogged me for it in the morning. 'Tis the best
song ever written.' He went on singing in a kind of whisper&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">
'We'll drink it out of the nipperkin, boys&mdash;<br />
</p>

<p>Robin&mdash;poor Robin! he is dead!&mdash;was a famous hand at singing
it; but Humphrey found the words too rustical. Humphrey&mdash;who
is now dead, too!&mdash;was ever for fine words, like Mr.
Boscorel.</p>

<p class="center">
'We'll drink it out of the jolly brown bowl&mdash;<br />
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span></p>

<p>'I think I see him now&mdash;poor Robin! Well; he is no more. He
used to laugh in all our faces while he sang it:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'We'll drink it out o' the river, my boys.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Here's a health to the barley-mow!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The river, the well, the pipe, the hogshead, the half-<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Hogshead, the anker, the half-anker, the gallon, the<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pottle, the quart, the pint, the half-pint, the quarter-<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pint, the nipperkin, the jolly brown bowl, my boys,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Here's a health to the barley-mow!'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noind">He trolled out the song in a melodious whisper. Oh! Barnaby,
how didst thou love good companionship with singing and
drinking!</p>

<p>''Twill be lonely for thee, Sister, at Bradford when thou dost
return; Sir Christopher, I take it, will not long hold up his head,
and Madam will pine away for the loss of Robin, and mother
looks as if she would follow after, so white and wan is she. If
she would speak or complain or cry it would comfort her, poor
soul! 'Twas a sad day for her when she married the poor old Dad.
Poverty and hard work, and now a cruel end&mdash;poor mother!'</p>

<p>'Barnaby, you tear my heart!'</p>

<p>'Nay, Child, 'tis better to talk than to keep silence. Better
have your heart torn than be choked with your pain. Thou art
like unto a man who hath a wounded leg, and if he doth not consent
to have it cut off, though the anguish be sharp, he will presently
bleed to death. Say to thyself therefore, plain and clear,
"Robin is dead; I have lost my sweetheart."'</p>

<p>'No&mdash;no&mdash;Barnaby&mdash;I cannot say those cruel words! Oh! I
cannot say them; I cannot feel that Robin is truly dead!'</p>

<p>'Put the case that he is living. Then he is either a prisoner
or he is in hiding. If a prisoner, he is as good as dead; because
the Duke's officers and the gentlemen who joined him, they will
never forgive&mdash;that is quite certain. If I were a prisoner I should
feel my neck already tightened. If he is not a prisoner, where is
he to hide?&mdash;whither betake himself? I can get sailors' duds and
go abroad before the mast; and ten to one nobody will find me
out, because, d'ye see, I can talk the sailors' language, and I know
their manners and customs. But Robin&mdash;what is Robin to do, if
he is alive? And this, I say, is doubtful. Best say to thyself,
"I have lost my sweetheart." So wilt thou all the sooner recover
thy cheerfulness.'</p>

<p>'Barnaby, you know not what you say! Alas! if my Robin
is dead&mdash;if my boy is truly dead&mdash;then I ask for nothing more
than swift death&mdash;speedy death&mdash;to join him and be with him!'</p>

<p>'If he escape he will make for Bradford Orcas and hide in the
Corton woods. That is quite certain. They always make for
home. I would that we were in that friendly place, so that you
could go live in the cottage and bring provisions, with tobacco
and drink, to us unsuspected and unseen. When we have rested
here a while we will push across the hills and try to get there by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
night; but it is a weary way to drag that wounded man. However'&mdash;he
broke off and said earnestly&mdash;'make up thy mind,
Child, to the worst. 'Tis as if a shipwrecked man should hope
that enough of the ship would float to carry him home withal.
Make up thy mind. We are all ruined and lost&mdash;all&mdash;all&mdash;all.
Thy father is dying&mdash;thy lover is dead&mdash;thou art thyself in great
danger by reason of that affair at Taunton. Everything being
gone, turn round therefore and make thyself as comfortable as
possible. What will happen we know not. Therefore count every
day of safety for gain, and every meal for a respite.'</p>

<p>He was silent for a while, leaving me to think over what he
had said. Here, indeed, was a philosopher. Things being all
lost, and our affairs in a desperate condition, we were to turn round
and make ourselves as comfortable as we could! This, I suppose,
is what sailors are wont to do; certainly they are a folk more
exposed to misfortune than others, and therefore, perhaps, more
ready to make the best of whatever happens.</p>

<p>'Barnaby,' I said presently, 'how can I turn round and make
myself comfortable?'</p>

<p>'The evening is still,' he said, without replying. 'See, there
is a bat, and there another. If it were not for the trouble in
there'&mdash;he pointed to the hut&mdash;'I should be easy in my mind and
contented. I could willingly live here a twelvemonth. Why,
compared with the lot of the poor devils who must now be in
prison, what is ours? They get the foul and stinking clink, with
bad food, in the midst of wounded men whose hurts are putrefying,
with jail fever, and with the whipping-post or the gallows to
come. We breathe sweet air, we find sufficient food&mdash;to-morrow,
if I know any of the signs, thou shalt taste a roasted hedgehog,
dish fit for a king! I found at the bottom of the comb a pot left
by some gipsies: thou shalt have boiled sorrel and mushrooms to
thy supper. If we stay here long enough there will be nuts and
blackberries and whortleberries. Pity, a thousand pities, there is
not a drop of drink! I dream of punch and hipsy. Think upon
what remains, even if thou canst not bear to think of what is
lost. Hast ever seen a tall ship founder in the waves? They
close over her as she sinks, and, in an instant, it is as if that tall
ship with all her crew had never been in existence at all. The
army of Monmouth is scattered and ruined. Well; it is, with us,
amidst these woods, just as if there had been no army. It has
been a dream perhaps. Who can tell? Sometimes all the past
seems to have been a dream. It is all a dream&mdash;past and future.
There is no past and there is no future; all is a dream. But the
present we have. Let us be content therewith.'</p>

<p>He spoke slowly and with measured accents as one enchanted.
Sometimes Barnaby was but a rough and rude sailor. At other
times, as these, he betrayed signs of his early education and spoke
as one who thought.</p>

<p>'It is ten years and more since last I breathed the air of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
hills. I knew not that I loved so much the woods and valleys and
the streams. Some day, if I survive this adventure, I will build
me a hut and live here alone in the woods. Why, if I were alone
I should have an easy heart. If I were driven out of one place I
could find another. I am in no hurry to get down among men
and towns. Let us all stay here and be happy. But there is
Dad&mdash;who lives not, yet is not dead. Sister, be thankful for thy
safety in the woods, and think not too much upon the dead.'</p>

<p>We lived in this manner, the weather being for the most part
fine and warm, but with showers now and then, for a fortnight or
thereabouts, no one coming up the comb and there being still no
sign of man's presence in the hills. Our daily fare consisted of
the wild birds snared by Barnaby, such creatures as rabbits, hedgehogs,
and the like, which he caught by ingenious ways, and trout
from the brook which he caught with a twisted pin or by tickling
them with his hand. There were also mushrooms and edible
leaves, such as the nettle, wild sorrel, and the like of which he
knew. These we boiled and ate. He also plucked the half-ripe
blackberries and boiled them to make a sour drink, and one which,
like the cider loved by our people, would grip his throat because he
could not endure plain cold water. And he made out of the bones
of the birds a kind of thin broth for my father, of which he daily
swallowed a teaspoonful or so. So that we fared well, if not
sumptuously. The bread, to be sure, which Barnaby left for
mother and me, was coming to the last crust, and I know not how
we should have got more without venturing into the nearest village.</p>

<p>Now, as I talked every night with my brother, I found out
what a brave and simple soul it was&mdash;always cheerful and hopeful,
talking always as if we were the most fortunate people in the
world, instead of the most miserable, and yet by keeping the truth
before me, preventing me from getting into another Fool's Paradise
as to our safety and Robin's escape, such as that into which I had
fallen after the army marched out of Taunton. I understand now,
that he was always thinking how to smooth and soften things for
us, so that we might not go distracted with anxiety and grief; finding
work for me, talking about other things&mdash;in short, the most thoughtful
and affectionate brother in all the world. As for my mother, he
could do nothing to move her. She still sat beside her wounded husband,
watching all day long for any sign of consciousness or change.</p>

<p>Seeing that Barnaby was so good and gentle a creature, I could
not understand how it was that in the old days he used to get a
flogging most days for some offence or other, so that I had grown
up to believe him a very wicked boy indeed. I put this question
to him one night.</p>

<p>He put it aside for a while, replying in his own fashion.</p>

<p>'I remember Dad,' he said, 'before thou canst, Sister. He
was always thin and tall, and he always stooped as he walked. But
his hair, which now is white, was brown, and fell in curls which he
could not straighten. He was always mighty grave; no one, I am<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
sure, ever saw him laugh; I have never seen him so much as smile,
except sometimes when he dandled thee upon his knee, and thou
wouldst amuse him with innocent prattle. All his life he hath
spent in finding out the way to Heaven. He did find the way&mdash;I
suppose he hath truly discovered it&mdash;and a mighty thorny and difficult
way it is, so that I know not how any can succeed in reaching
port by such navigation. The devil of it is that he believes there
is no other way; and he seemed never so happy as when he had
found another trap or pitfall to catch the unwary, and send them
straight to hell.</p>

<p>'For my part,' Barnaby went on slowly, 'I could never love
such a life. Let others, if they will, find out rough and craggy
ways that lead to heaven. For my part, I am content to jog along
the plain and smooth high road with the rest of mankind, though
it brings us in the end to a lower place, inhabited by the baser
sort. Well, I dare say I shall find mates there, and we will certainly
make ourselves as comfortable as the place allows. Let my
father, therefore, find out what awaits him in the other world;
let me take what comes in this. Some of it is sweet and some is
bitter; some of it makes us laugh and sing and dance; and some
makes us curse and swear and bellow out, as when one is lashed to
the hatches and the cat falls on his naked back. Sometimes,
Sister, I think the naked negroes of the Guiney Coast the happiest
people in the world. Do they trouble their heads about the way
to heaven? Not they. What comes they take, and they ask no
more. Has it made Dad the happier to find out how few are those
who will sit beside him when he hath his harp and crown? Not
so. He would have been happier if he had been a jolly ploughboy
whistling to his team, or a jolly sailor singing over his pannikin
of drink of a Saturday night. He tried to make me follow in his
footsteps; he flogged me daily in the hope of making me take, like
himself, to the trade of proving out of the Holy Bible that most
people are surely damned. The more he flogged, the less I yearned
after that trade; till at last I resolved that, come what would, I
would never thump a pulpit like him in conventicle or church.
Then, if you will believe me, Sister, I grew tired of flogging, which,
when it comes every day, wearies a boy at fourteen or fifteen more
than you would think. Now, one day, while I was dancing to the
pipe and tabor with some of the village girls, as bad luck would
have it, Dad came by. "Child of Satan!" he roared, seizing me
by the ear, which I verily thought he would have pulled off. Then
to the girls, "Your laughter shall be turned into mourning," and
so lugged me home and sent me supperless to bed, with the promise
of such a flogging in the morning as should make all previous
floggings seem mere fleabites or joyous ticklings in comparison.
This decided me. So in the dead of night I crept softly down the
stairs, cut myself a great hunch of bread and cheese, and ran away
and went to sea.'</p>

<p>'Barnaby, was it well done&mdash;to run away?'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span></p>

<p>'Well, Sister, 'tis done; and if it was ill done, 'tis by this
time, no doubt, forgotten. Now, remember, I blame not my
father. Before all things he would save my soul alive. That was
why he flogged me. He knew but one way, and along that way he
would drive me. So he flogged me the harder. I blame him not.
Yet had I remained he would doubtless be flogging me still. Now,
remember again, that ever since I understood anything I have
always been enraged to think upon the monstrous oppression which
silenced him and brought us all to poverty, and made my mother,
a gentlewoman born, work her fingers to the bone, and caused me
to choose between being a beggarly scholar, driven to teach brats
and endure flouts and poverty, or to put on an apron and learn a
trade. Wherefore when I found that Monmouth was going to hoist
his flag, I came with him in order to strike a blow, and I hoped a
good blow, too, at the oppressors.'</p>

<p>'You have struck that blow, Barnaby, and where are we?'</p>

<p>He laughed.</p>

<p>'We are in hiding. Some of the King's troopers did I make to
bite the dust. They may hang me for it, if they will. They will
not bring those troopers back to life. Well&mdash;&mdash;Sister, I am sleepy.
Good night!'</p>

<p>We might have continued this kind of life I know not how
much longer. Certainly, till the cold nights came. The weather
continued fine and warm; the hut kept off dews at night; we lay
warm among the heather and the ferns; Barnaby found a sufficiency
of food; my father grew no worse, to outward seeming; and we
seemed in safety.</p>

<p>Then an ill chance and my own foolishness marred all.</p>

<p>One day, in the afternoon, Barnaby being away looking after
his snares and gins, I heard, lower down the comb, voices as of boys
talking. This affrighted me terribly. The voices seemed to be
drawing nearer. Now if the children came up as high as our encampment,
they could not fail to see the signs of habitation.
There was the hut among the trees and the iron pot standing
among the grey embers of last night's fire. The cart stood on one
side. We could not possibly remain hidden. If they should come
up so far and find us, they would certainly carry the report of us
down to the village.</p>

<p>I considered, therefore, what to do, and then ran quickly down
the comb, keeping among the trees so as not to be seen.</p>

<p>After a little I discovered, a little way off, a couple of boys
about nine years of age. They were common village boys, rosy
faced and wholesome: they carried a basket, and they were slowly
making their way up the stream, stopping now to throw a stone at
a squirrel, and now to dam the running water, and now to find a
nut or filbert ripe enough to be eaten. By the basket which they
carried I knew that they were come in search of whortleberries, for
which purpose they would have to get quite to the end of the comb
and the top of the hill.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span></p>

<p>Therefore, I stepped out of the wood and asked them whence
they came and whither they were going.</p>

<p>They told me in plain Somersetshire (the language which I love,
and would willingly have written this book in it, but for the unfortunate
people who cannot understand it) that they were sent by
their parents to get whortleberries, and that they came from the
little village of Corfe, two miles down the valley. This was all
they had to say, and they stared at me as shyly as if they had
never before encountered a stranger. I clearly perceive now that
I ought to have engaged them in conversation and drawn them
gently down the valley in the direction of their village until we
reached the first appearance of a road, when I could have bidden
them farewell or sent them up the hill by another comb. But I
was so anxious that they should not come up any higher that I
committed a great mistake, and warned them against going on.</p>

<p>'Boys,' I said, 'beware! If you go higher up the comb you
will certainly meet wild men, who always rob and beat boys;'
here they trembled, though they had not a penny in the world.
'Ay, boys! and sometimes have been known to murder them.
Turn back&mdash;turn back&mdash;and come no farther.'</p>

<p>The boys were very much frightened, partly at the apparition
of a stranger where they expected to find no one, and partly at the
news of wild and murderous men in a place where they had never
met with anyone at all, unless it might have been a gipsy camp.
After gazing at me stupidly for a little while they turned and ran
away, as fast as their legs could carry them, down the comb.</p>

<p>I watched them running, and when they were out of sight I
went back again, still disquieted, because they might return.</p>

<p>When I told Barnaby in the evening, he, too, was uneasy. For,
he said, the boys would spread abroad the report that there were
people in the valley. What people could there be but fugitives?</p>

<p>'Sister,' he said, 'to-morrow morning must we change our
quarters. On the other side of the hills looking south, or to the
east in Neroche Forest, we may make another camp, and be still
more secluded. For to-night I think we are in safety.'</p>

<p>What happened was exactly as Barnaby thought. For the lads
ran home and told everybody that up in the comb there were wild
men who robbed and murdered people: that a lady had come out
of the wood and warned them to go no farther, lest they should be
robbed and murdered. They were certain it was a lady, and not a
country-woman; nor was it a witch; nor a fairy or elf, of whom
there are many on Black Down. No; it was a lady.</p>

<p>This strange circumstance set the villagers a-talking; they
talked about it at the inn, whither they nightly repaired.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 436px;">
<img src="images/i_185.jpg" width="436" height="600" alt="beware" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">'<i>"Boys," I said, "beware; if you go up higher you will certainly
meet wild men."</i>'</p></div>
</div>

<p>In ordinary times they might have talked about it to their
heart's content, and no harm done; but in these times talk was
dangerous. In every little village there are one or two whose wits
are sharper than the rest, and, therefore, they do instigate whatever
mischief is done in that village. At Corfe, the cobbler it was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
who did the mischief. For he sat thinking while the others talked,
and he presently began to understand that there was more in this
than his fellows imagined. He knew the hills; there were no wild
men upon them who would rob and murder two simple village boys.
Gipsies there were, and broom-squires sometimes, and hedge-tearers:
but murderers of boys&mdash;none. And who was this gentlewoman?
Then he guessed the whole truth: there were people
lying hidden in the comb; if people hidden, they were Monmouth's
rebels. A reward would be given for their capture. Fired with
this thought he grasped his cudgel and walked off to the village of
Orchard Portman, where, as he had heard, there was lying a company
of Grenadiers sent out to scour the country. He laid his
information, and received the promise of reward. He got that
reward, in short; but nothing prospered with him afterwards.
His neighbours, who were all for Monmouth, learned what he had
done, and shunned him. He grew moody; he fell into poverty,
who had been a thriving tradesman; and he died in a ditch. The
judgments of the Lord are sometimes swift and sometimes slow,
yet they are always sure. Who can forget the dreadful end of Tom
Boilman, as he was called, the only wretch who could be found to
cut up the limbs of the hanged men and dip them in the cauldrons
of pitch? For he was struck dead by lightning&mdash;an awful instance
of the wrath of God!</p>

<p>Early next morning, about five of the clock, I sat before the hut
in the shade. Barnaby was up and had gone to look at his snares.
Suddenly I heard steps below, and the sound as of weapons clashing
against each other. Then a man came into sight&mdash;a fellow he
was with a leathern apron, who stood gazing about him. There
was no time for me to hide, because he immediately saw me and
shouted to them behind to come on quickly. Then a dozen soldiers,
all armed, ran out of the wood and made for the hut.</p>

<p>'Gentlemen,' I cried, running to meet them, 'whom seek
you?'</p>

<p>'Who are you?' asked one, who seemed to be a Sergeant over
them. 'Why are you in hiding?'</p>

<p>Then a thought struck me. I know not if I was wise or foolish.</p>

<p>'Sir,' I replied, 'my father, it is true, was with the Duke of
Monmouth. But he was wounded, and now lies dead in this hut.
You will suffer us to bury our dead in peace.'</p>

<p>'Dead is he? That will we soon see.'</p>

<p>So saying, he entered the hut and looked at the prostrate form.
He lifted one hand and let it drop. It fell like the hand of one
who is recently dead. He bent over the body and laid his hand
upon the forehead. It was cold as death. The lips were pale as
wax, and the cheeks were white. He opened an eye: there was
no expression of light in it.</p>

<p>'Humph!' he said; 'he seems dead. How did he come here?'</p>

<p>'My mother and I drove him here for safety in yonder cart.
The pony hath run away.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span></p>

<p>'That may be so; that may be so. He is dressed in a cassock:
what is his name?'</p>

<p>'He was Dr. Comfort Eykin, an ejected minister and preacher
in the Duke's army.'</p>

<p>'A prize, if he had been alive!' Then a sudden suspicion
seized him. He had in his hand a drawn sword. He pointed it
at the breast of the dead man. 'If he be truly dead,' he said,
'another wound will do him no harm. Wherefore'&mdash;he made as if
he would drive the sword through my father's breast, and my
mother shrieked and threw herself across the body.</p>

<p>'So!' he said, with a horrid grin, 'I find that he is not dead,
but only wounded. My lads, here is one of Monmouth's preachers;
but he is sore wounded.'</p>

<p>'Oh!' I cried, 'for the love of God suffer him to die in peace!'</p>

<p>'Ay, ay, he shall die in peace, I promise you so much. Meanwhile,
Madam, we will take better care of him in Ilminster Jail
than you can do here. The air is raw upon these hills.' The
fellow had a glib tongue and a mocking manner. 'You have none
of the comforts which a wounded man requires. They are all to be
found in Ilminster prison, whither we shall carry him. There will
he have nothing to think about, with everything found for him.
Madam, your father will be well bestowed with us.'</p>

<p>At that moment I heard the footsteps of Barnaby crunching
among the brushwood.</p>

<p>'Fly! Barnaby, fly!' I shrieked. 'The enemy is upon us!'</p>

<p>He did not fly. He came running. He rushed upon the
soldiers, and hurled this man one way and that man another, swinging
his long arms like a pair of cudgels. Had he had a cudgel I
believe he would have sent them all flying. But he had nothing
except his arms and his fists; and in a minute or two the soldiers
had surrounded him, each with a bayonet pointed, and such a look
in every man's eye as meant murder had Barnaby moved.</p>

<p>'Surrender!' said the Sergeant.</p>

<p>Barnaby looked around leisurely.</p>

<p>'Well,' he said, 'I suppose I must. As for my name, it is
Barnaby Eykin; and, for my rank, I was Captain in the Green Regiment
of the Duke's valiant army.'</p>

<p>'Stop!' said the Sergeant, drawing a paper from his pocket.
'"Captain Eykin,"' he began to read, '"has been a sailor.
Rolls in his walk; height, about five foot five; very broad in the
shoulders; long in the arms; of great strength."'</p>

<p>'That is so,' said Barnaby, complacently.</p>

<p>'"Legs short and figure stumpy."'</p>

<p>'What?' cried Barnaby, 'stumpy?'</p>

<p>'"Legs short and figure stumpy,"' repeated the Sergeant reading.</p>

<p>'That is so set down is it? Then,' said Barnaby, looking down
at his limbs, ''twas a pity that, with such legs as these, I did not
deny my name. Call these short, brother?'</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXV.</h2>

<h3>ILMINSTER CLINK.</h3>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 242px;">
<img src="images/i_189.jpg" width="242" height="350" alt="How" />
</div>

<p>How can I tell&mdash;oh! how can I
sit down to tell in cold blood
the story of all that followed?
Some parts of it for very pity
I must pass over. All that
has been told or written of
the Bloody Assize is most
true, and yet not half that happened
can be told. There are
things, I mean, which the historian
cannot, for the sake of
pity, decency, and consideration for
living people, relate, even if he hath
seen them. You who read the printed
page may learn how in one place so
many were hanged; in another place
so many; how some were hung in gemmaces,
so that at every cross-road there
was a frightful gibbet with a dead man on
it; how some died of small-pox in the
crowded prisons, and some of fever; and
how Judge Jeffreys rode from town to town, followed
by gangs of miserable prisoners driven after him to
stand their trial in towns where they would be known;
how the wretched sufferers were drawn and quartered,
and their limbs seethed in pitch, and stuck up over the whole
country; how the women and boys of tender years were flogged
through market-towns&mdash;you, I say, who read these things on the
cold page presently (even if you be a stickler for the Right Divine
and hold rebellion as a mortal sin) feel your blood to boil with
righteous wrath. The hand of the Lord was afterwards heavy
upon those who ordered these things; nay, at the very time (this
is a most remarkable Judgment, and one little known) when this
inhuman Judge was thundering at his victims&mdash;so that some went
mad and even dropped down dead with fear&mdash;he was himself, as
Humphrey hath assured me, suffering the most horrible pain from
a dire disease; so that the terrors of his voice and of his fiery
eyes were partly due to the agony of his disease, and he was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
enduring all through that Assize, in his own body, pangs greater
than any that he ordered! As for his miserable end, and the fate
that overtook his master, that we know; and candid souls cannot
but confess that here were truly Judgments of God, visible for all
to see and acknowledge. But no pen can truly depict what the eye
saw and the ear heard during that terrible time. And, think you,
if it was a terrible and a wretched time for those who had no relations
among the rebels, and only looked on and saw these bloody
executions and heard the lamentations of the poor women who lost
their lovers or their husbands, what must it have been for me, and
those like me, whose friends and all whom they loved&mdash;yea, all,
all!&mdash;were overwhelmed in one common ruin, and expected nothing
but death?</p>

<p>Our own misery I cannot truly set forth. Sometimes the
memory of it comes back to me, and it is as if long afterwards
one should feel again the sharpness of the surgeon's knife. Oh!
since I must write down what happened, let me be brief. And
you who read it, if you find the words cold where you would have
looked for fire; if you find no tears where there should have been
weeping and wailing, remember that in the mere writing have been
shed again (but these you cannot see) the tears which belonged to
that time, and in the writing have been renewed (but these you
cannot hear) the sobbings and wailings and terrors of that dreadful
autumn.</p>

<p>The soldiers belonged to a company of Grenadiers of Trelawny's
Regiment, stationed at Ilminster, whither they carried
the prisoners. First they handcuffed Barnaby, but, on his giving
his parole not to escape, they let him go free; and he proved useful
in the handling of the cart on which my unhappy father lay.
And, though the soldiers' talk was ribald, their jests unseemly, and
their cursing and swearing seemed verily to invite the wrath of
God, yet they proved honest fellows in the main. They offered no
rudeness to us, nor did they object to our going with the prisoners;
nay, they even gave us bread and meat and cider from their own
provisions when they halted for dinner at noon. Barnaby walked
sometimes with the soldiers, and sometimes with us; with them
he talked freely, and as if he were their comrade and not their
prisoner: with us he put in a word of encouragement or consolation,
such as 'Mother, we shall find a way out of this coil yet;'
or 'Sister, we shall cheat Tom Hangman. Look not so gloomy
upon it;' or, again, he reminded us that many a shipwrecked
sailor gets safe ashore, and that where there are so many they
cannot hang all. 'Would the King,' he asked, 'hang up the
whole county of Somerset?' But he had already told me too
much. In his heart I knew he had small hope of escape; yet he
preserved his cheerfulness, and walked towards his prison (to outward
seeming) as insensible of fear, and with as unconcerned a
countenance as if he were going to a banquet or a wedding. This
cheerfulness of his was due to a happy confidence in the ordering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
of things rather than to insensibility. A sailor sees men die in
many ways, yet himself remains alive. This gives him something
of the disposition of the Oriental, who accepts his fate with outward
unconcern, whatever it may be. Perhaps (I know not) there
may have been in his mind that religious Assurance of which he
had told me. Did Barnaby at this period, when death was very
near unto him, really believe that there was one religion for landsmen
and another for sailors&mdash;one way to heaven for ministers,
another for seamen? Indeed, I cannot tell; yet how otherwise
account for his courage and cheerfulness at all times&mdash;even in the
very presence of death?</p>

<p>'Brother,' he asked the Sergeant, 'we have been lying hid for
a fortnight, and have heard no news. Tell me, how go the
hangings?'</p>

<p>'Why, Captain,' the fellow replied with a grin, 'in this respect
there is little for the rebels to complain of. They ought to be
satisfied, so far, with the attentions paid to them. Lord Feversham
hanged twenty odd to begin with. Captain Adlan and three
others are trussed up in chains for their greater honour; and,
in order to put the rest in good heart, one of them ran a race
with a horse, being promised his life if he should win. When he
had beaten the horse, his Lordship, who was ever a merry man,
ordered him to be hanged just to laugh at him. And hanged he
was.'</p>

<p>'Ay,' said Barnaby, 'thus do the Indians in America torture
their prisoners first and kill them afterwards.'</p>

<p>'There are two hundred prisoners laying in Weston Zoyland
church,' the Sergeant went on; 'they would have been hanged,
too, but the Bishop interfered. Now they are waiting to be tried.
Lord! what signifies trial, except to give them longer rope?'</p>

<p>'Ay, ay; and how go things in Bridgwater and Taunton?'</p>

<p>'From Weston to Bridgwater there is a line of gibbets already;
in Taunton, twenty, I believe, have swung&mdash;twenty, at least. The
drums beat, the fifes played, and the trumpets sounded, and
Colonel Kirke drank to the health of every man (such was his
condescension!) before he was turned off. 'Twould have done
your heart good, Captain, only to see the brave show.'</p>

<p>'Ay, ay,' said Barnaby, unmoved; 'very like, very like. Perhaps
I shall have the opportunity of playing first part in another
brave show if all goes well. Hath the Duke escaped?'</p>

<p>'We heard yesterday that he is taken somewhere near the New
Forest. So that he will before long lay his lovely head upon the
block. Captain, your friends have brought their pigs to a pretty
market.'</p>

<p>'They have, Brother; they have,' replied Barnaby, still with
unmoved countenance. 'Yet many a man hath recovered from
worse straits than these.'</p>

<p>I listened with sinking heart. Much I longed to ask if the
Sergeant knew aught of Robin; but I refrained, lest merely to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
name him might put the soldiers on the look-out for him, should
he, happily, be in hiding.</p>

<p>Next the Sergeant told us (which terrified me greatly) that there
was no part of the country where they were not scouring for fugitives;
that they were greatly assisted by the clergy, who, he said, were
red-hot for King James; that the men were found hiding, as we
had hidden, in linneys, in hedges, in barns, in woods; that they
were captured by treachery&mdash;by information laid, and even, most
cruel thing of all, by watching and following the men's sweethearts
who were found taking food to them. He said also that, at the
present rate, they would have to enlarge their prisons to admit ten
times their number, for they were haling into them not only the
men who had followed Monmouth, but also those who had helped
him with money, arms, or men. The Sergeant was a brutal fellow,
yet there was about him something of good nature, and even of
compassion for the men he had captured. But he seemed to take
delight in speaking of the sufferings of the unfortunate prisoners.
The soldiers, he told us, were greatly enraged towards the rebels&mdash;not,
I suppose, on account of their rebellion, because three years
later they themselves showed how skin-deep was their loyalty, but
because the rustics, whom they thought contemptible, had surprised
and nearly beaten them. And this roused in them the spirit of
revenge.</p>

<p>'Captain,' said the Sergeant, ''tis pity that so lusty a gentleman
as thou shouldst die. Hast thou no friends at Court? No? Nor
any who would speak for thee? 'Tis pity. Yet a man can die but
once. With such a thick neck as thine, bespeak, if so much grace
be accorded thee, a long rope and a high gallows. Else, when it
comes to the quartering'&mdash;he stopped and shook his head&mdash;'but
there&mdash;I wish you well out of it, Captain.'</p>

<p>In the evening, just before sunset, we arrived at Ilminster, after
a sad and weary march of ten miles, at least; but we could not leave
the prisoners until we knew how and where they were bestowed;
and during all this time my mother, who commonly walked not
abroad from one Sabbath to the next, was possessed with such a spirit
that she seemed to feel no weariness. When we rode all night in
order to join the Duke she complained not; when we rode painfully
across the hills to Taunton she murmured not; nor when we
carried our wounded man up the rough and steep comb; no, nor
on this day, when she walked beside her husband's head, careful
lest the motion of the cart should cause him pain. But he felt
nothing, poor soul! He would feel nothing any more.</p>

<p>Ilminster is a goodly town, rich and prosperous with its spinners
and weavers. This evening, however, there was no one in the
streets except the troopers, who swaggered up and down or sat
drinking at the tavern door. There is a broad open place before
the market, which stands upon great stone pillars. Outside the
market is the Clink, whither the soldiers were taking their prisoners.
The troopers paid not the least heed to our mournful little procession&mdash;a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
wounded man; a prisoner in scarlet and lace, but the cloth
tattered and stained and the lace torn. They were only two more
men on their way to death. What doth a soldier care for the sight
of a man about to die?</p>

<p>'Mother,' said Barnaby when we drew near the prison gates,
'come not within. I will do all that I can for him. Go now and
find a decent lodging, and, Sister, hark ye, the lads in our army
were rough, but they were as lambs compared with these swaggering
troopers. Keep snug, therefore, and venture not far abroad.'</p>

<p>I whispered in his ear that I had his bag of money safe, so that
he could have whatever he wanted if that could be bought. Then
the prison gates were closed, and we stood without.</p>

<p>It would have been hard indeed if the wife and daughter of Dr.
Comfort Eykin could not find a lodging among godly people, of
whom there are always many in every town of Somerset. We
presently obtained a room in the house of one Martha Prior, widow
of the learned and pious Joshua Prior, whilom preacher and ejected
minister. Her case was as hard as our own. This poor woman had
two sons only, and both had gone to join the Duke; one already
risen to be a Master Serge-maker and one a Draper of the town.
Of her sons she could hear no news at all: whether they were alive
or dead. If they were already dead, or if they should be hanged,
she would have no means of support, and so must starve or eat the
bread of charity. (I learned afterwards that she never did hear
anything of them, so that it is certain that they must have been
killed on the battle-field or cut down by the dragoons in trying to
escape. But the poor soul survived not long their loss.)</p>

<p>The church of Ilminster stands upon a rising ground; on the
north of the church is the grammar school, and on the other three
sides are houses of the better sort, of which Mrs. Prior had one.
The place, which surrounds the churchyard, and hath no inn or
ale-house in it, is quiet and retired. The soldiers came not thither,
except once or twice, with orders to search the houses (and with a
private resolution to drink everything that they might lay their
hands upon), so that, for two poor women in our miserable circumstances,
we could not have a more quiet lodging.</p>

<p>Despite our troubles, I slept so well that night that it was past
seven in the morning when I awoke. The needs of the body do sometimes
overcome the cares of the spirit. For a whole fortnight had we
been making our beds on the heather, and, therefore, without taking
off our clothes; and that day we had walked ten miles, at least, with
the soldiers, so that I slept without moving or waking all the night.
In the morning, I dressed quickly and hurried to the jail, not
knowing whether I might be admitted or should be allowed speech
of Barnaby. Outside the gate, however, I found a crowd of people
going into the prison and coming out of it. Some of them, women
like ourselves, were weeping&mdash;they were those whose brothers or
lovers, husbands or sons, were in those gloomy walls. Others there
were who brought, for such of the prisoners as had money to buy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
them, eggs, butter, white bread, chickens, fruit, and all kinds of
provisions; some brought wine, cider, and ale; some, tobacco. The
warders who stood at the gates made no opposition to those who
would enter. I pressed in with a beating heart, prepared for a
scene of the most dreadful repentance and gloomy forebodings.
What I saw was quite otherwise.</p>

<p>The gates of the prison opened upon a courtyard, not very big,
where the people were selling their wares, and some of the prisoners
were walking about, and some were chaffering with the women who
had the baskets. On the right-hand side of the yard was the Clink
itself; on the left hand were houses for the warders or officers of
the prison. In general, a single warder, constable, or head-borough
is enough for a town such as Ilminster, to keep the peace of the
prison, which is for the most part empty, save when they enforce
some new Act against Nonconformists and fill it with them or with
Quakers. Now, however, so great was the press that, instead of
two, there were a dozen guards, and, while a stout cudgel had always
been weapon enough, now every man went armed with pike and
cutlass to keep order and prevent escapes. Six of them occupied
the gate-house; other six were within, in a sort of guard-house,
where they slept on the left hand of the court.</p>

<p>The ground floor of the Clink we found to be a large room, at
least forty feet each side in bigness. On one side of it was a great
fireplace, where, though it was the month of July, there was burning
a great fire of Welsh coal, partly for cooking purposes, because
all that the prisoners ate was cooked at this fire; and partly because
a great fire kept continually burning sweetens the air, and wards
off jail fever. On another side was a long table and several benches.
Thick wooden pillars supported the joists of the rooms above; the
windows were heavily barred, but the shutters had been taken
down, and there was no glass in them. In spite of fire and open
windows, the place was stifling, and smelt most horrible. Never
have I breathed so foul an air. There lived in this room about
eighty prisoners (later on the numbers were doubled); some were
smoking tobacco and drinking cider or ale; some were frying pieces
of meat or smoked herrings over the fire; and the tobacco, the ale,
the wine, the cooking, and the people themselves&mdash;nearly all
country lads, unwashed, who had slept since Sedgemoor, at least,
in the same clothes without once changing&mdash;made so foul an air
that jail fever, putrid throats, and small-pox (all of which afterwards
broke out) should have been expected sooner.</p>

<p>They were all talking, laughing, and even singing, so that, in
addition to the noisome stench of the place, there was such a din
as one may hear at Sherborne Fair of an evening. I expected, as I
have said, a gloomy silence with the rattling of chains, the groans
of those who looked for death, and, perhaps, a godly repentance
visible upon every countenance. Yet they were all laughing, except
a few who sat retired and who were wounded. I say that they
were all laughing. They had nothing to expect but death, or at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
the best to be horribly flogged, to be transported, to be fined,
branded, and ruined. Yet they laughed! What means this hardness
and indifference in men? Could they not think of the
women they had left at home? I warrant that none of them were
laughing.</p>

<p>Among them&mdash;a pipe of tobacco in his lips and a mug of strong
ale before him on the table, his hat flung backwards&mdash;sat Barnaby,
his face showing, apparently, complete satisfaction with his lot.</p>

<p>When he saw us at the door, he rose and came to meet us.</p>

<p>'Welcome,' he said. 'This is one of the places where King
Monmouth's men are to receive the honour due to them. Courage,
gentle hearts. Be not cast down. Everywhere the prisons are
full, and more are brought in every day. Our very numbers are
our safety. They cannot hang us all. And hark!' here he whispered,
'Sister, we now know that Colonel Kirke hath been selling
pardons at ten pounds, twenty pounds, and thirty pounds apiece.
Wherefore we are well assured that somehow or other we shall be
able to buy our release. There are plenty besides Colonel Kirke
who will sell a prisoner his freedom.'</p>

<p>'Where is your father?' asked my mother.</p>

<p>'He is bestowed above, where it is quieter, except for the
groaning of the wounded. Go up-stairs, and you will find him.
And there is a surprise for you, besides. You will find with him
one you little expect to see.'</p>

<p>'Oh! Barnaby, is there new misery for me? Is Robin a
prisoner?'</p>

<p>'Robin is not here, Sis; and as for misery, why, that is as you
take it. To be sure the man above is in prison, but no harm will
happen to him. Why should it? He did not go out with Monmouth's
men. But go up-stairs&mdash;go up-stairs, and see for yourselves.'</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVI.</h2>

<h3>SIR CHRISTOPHER.</h3>


<div class="drop">
<img src="images/i_196.jpg" alt="I" width="100" height="99" class="cap" />
 <p class="cap_1">I know not whom I expected to find in consequence
of Barnaby's words, as we went up the dark and dirty
stairs which led to the upper room. Robin was not
a prisoner. Why&mdash;then&mdash;but I knew not what I
thought, all being strange and dreadful.</p>
</div>

<p>At the top of the stairs we found ourselves in a room of the
same size as the lower chamber, but not so high, and darker, being
a gloomy place indeed, insomuch that it was not for some minutes
that one could plainly discern things. It was lighted by a low,
long window, set very close with thick bars, the shutters thrown
open so that all the light and air possible to be admitted might
come in. It had a great fireplace, but there was no fire burning,
and the air of the room struck raw, though outside it was a warm
and sunny day. The roof was supported, as in the room below, by
means of thick square pillars, studded with great nails set close
together, for what purpose I know not. Every part of the woodwork
in the room was in the same way stuck full of nails. On the
floor lay half a score mattresses, the property of those who could
afford to pay the warders an exorbitant fee for the luxury. At
Ilminster, as I am told, at Newgate, the chief prison of the country,
the same custom obtains of exacting heavy fees from the poor
wretches clapped into ward. It is, I suppose, no sin to rob the
criminal, the debtor, the traitor, or the rebel. For those who had
nothing to pay there were only a few bundles of straw, and on these
were lying half a dozen wretches, whose white faces and glazed eyes
showed that they would indeed cheat Tom the Hangman, though
not in the way that Barnaby hoped. These were wounded either
in the Sedgemoor fight or in their attempt to escape.</p>

<p>My father lay on a pallet bed. His face showed not the least
change; his eyes were closed, and you would have thought him
dead; and beside him, also on a pallet, sat, to my astonishment,
none other than Sir Christopher himself.</p>

<p>He rose and came to meet us, smiling sadly.</p>

<p>'Madam,' he said, taking my mother's hand, 'we meet in a
doleful place, and we are, indeed, in wretched plight. I cannot
bid you welcome; I cannot say that I am glad to see you. There
is nothing that I can say of comfort or of hope, except, which you
know already, that we are always in the hands of the Lord.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span></p>

<p>'Sir Christopher,' said my mother, 'it was kind and neighbourly
in you to come. But you were always his best friend. Look
at his poor white face!' she only thought upon her husband. 'You
would think him dead! More than a fortnight he hath lain thus&mdash;motionless.
I think he feels no pain. Husband, if thou canst
hear me, make some sign&mdash;if it be but to open one eye! No!'
she cried. 'Day after day have I thus entreated him and he makes
no answer! He neither sees nor hears! Yet he doth not die;
wherefore I think that he may yet recover speech and sit up again,
and presently, perhaps, walk about, and address himself again unto
his studies.'</p>

<p>She waited not for any answer, but knelt down beside him and
poured some drops of milk into the mouth of the sick man. Sir
Christopher looked at her mournfully and shook his head.</p>

<p>Then he turned to me, and kissed me without saying a word.</p>

<p>'Oh! Sir,' I cried, 'how could you know that my father would
be brought unto this place? With what goodness of heart have you
come to our help!'</p>

<p>'Nay, child,' he replied gravely, 'I came because I had no
choice but to come. Like your father and your brother, Alice, I
am a prisoner.'</p>

<p>'You, Sir? You a prisoner? Why, you were not with the
Duke.'</p>

<p>'That is most true. And yet a prisoner. Why, after the news
of Sedgemoor fight I looked for nothing else. They tried to arrest
Mr. Speke, but he has fled; they have locked up Mr. Prideaux, of
Ford Abbey; Mr. Trenchard has retired across the seas. Why
should they pass me over? Nay, there were abundant proofs of
my zeal for the Duke. My grandson and my grandnephew had
joined the rebels. Your father and brother rode over to Lyme on
my horses; with my grandson rode off a dozen lads of the village.
What more could they want? Moreover, I am an old soldier of
Lord Essex's army; and, to finish, they found in the window-seat
a copy of Monmouth's Declaration&mdash;which, indeed, I had forgotten,
or I might have destroyed it.'</p>

<p>'Alas! alas!' I cried, wringing my hands. 'Your Honour,
too, a prisoner!'</p>

<p>Since the Sergeant spoke to Barnaby about the interest of
friends, I had been thinking that Sir Christopher, whose power and
interest, I fondly thought, must be equal to those of any Lord in
the land, would interpose to save us all. And he was now a
prisoner himself, involved in the common ruin! One who stands
upon a bridge and sees with terror the last support carried away by
the raging flood feels such despair as fell upon my soul.</p>

<p>'Oh, Sir!' I cried again. 'It is Line upon Line&mdash;Woe upon
Woe!'</p>

<p>He took my hand in his, and held it tenderly.</p>

<p>'My child,' he said, 'to an old man of seventy-five what doth
it matter whether he die in his bed or whether he die upon a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
scaffold? Through the pains of death, as through a gate, we enter
upon our rest.'</p>

<p>'It is dreadful!' I cried again. 'I cannot endure it!'</p>

<p>'The shame and ignominy of this death,' he said, 'I shall, I
trust, regard lightly. We have struck a blow for Freedom and for
Faith. Well; we have been suffered to fail. The time hath not
yet come. Yet, in the end, others shall carry on the Cause, and
Religion shall prevail. Shall we murmur who have been God's
instruments?'</p>

<p>'Alas! alas!' I cried again.</p>

<p>'To me, sweet child, it is not terrible to contemplate my end.
But it is sad to think of thee, and of thy grave and bitter loss.
Hast thou heard news of Robin and of Humphrey?'</p>

<p>'Oh, Sir!&mdash;are they also in prison&mdash;are they here?'</p>

<p>'No; but I have news of them. I have a letter brought to me
but yesterday. Read it, my child, read it.'</p>

<p>He pulled the letter out of his pocket and gave it to me. Then
I read aloud, and thus it ran:&mdash;</p>

<p>
'Honoured Sir and Grandfather,<br />
</p>

<p>'I am writing this letter from the prison of Exeter, where, with
Humphrey and about two hundred or more of our poor fellows, I
am laid by the heels, and shall so continue until we shall all be
tried.</p>

<p>'It is rumoured that Lord Jeffreys will come down to try us,
and we are assured by report that the King shows himself revengeful,
and is determined that there shall be no mercy shown. After
Sedgemoor fight they hanged, as you will have heard, many of the
prisoners at Weston Zoyland, at Bridgwater, and at Taunton,
without trial. If the King continue in this disposition it is very
certain that, though the common sort may be forgiven, the gentlemen
and those who were officers in the rebel army will certainly
not escape. Therefore I have no hope but to conclude my life
upon the gallows&mdash;a thing which, I confess, I had never looked to
do. But I hope to meet my fate with courage and resignation.</p>

<p>'Humphrey is with me, and it is some comfort (though I know
not why) that we shall stand or fall together; for if I was a Captain
in the army he was a Chyrurgeon. That he was also a secret
agent of the exiles, and that he stirred up the Duke's friends on
his way from London to Sherborne, that they know not, or it
would certainly go hard with him. What do I say? Since they
will hang him, things cannot very well go harder.</p>

<p>'When the fight was over, and the Duke and Lord Grey fled,
there was nothing left but to escape as best we might. I hope that
some of the Bradford lads will make their way home in safety:
they stood their ground and fought valiantly. Nay, if we had been
able to arm all who volunteered and would have enlisted, and if
our men had all shown such a spirit as your valiant lads of Bradford
Orcas, then, I say, the enemy must have been cut to pieces.</p>

<p>'When we had no choice left but to run, I took the road to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
Bridgwater, intending to ride back to that place, where, perhaps,
our forces might be rallied. But this proved hopeless. There I
found, however, Humphrey, and we resolved that the safest plan
would be to ride by way of Taunton and Exeter, leaving behind us
the great body of the King's army, and so escape to London if
possible, where we should certainly find hiding-places in plenty,
until the pursuit should be at an end. Our plan was to travel
along byways and bridle-paths, and that by night only, hiding by
day in barns, linneys, and the like. We had money for the charges
of our journey. Humphrey would travel as a physician returning
to London from the West as soon as we had gotten out of the insurgents'
country; I was to be his servant. Thus we arranged the
matter in our minds, and already I thought that we were safe, and
in hiding somewhere in London, or across the seas in the Low
Countries again.</p>

<p>'Well, to make short my story, we got no further than Exeter,
where we were betrayed by a rascal countryman who recognised us,
caused us to be arrested, and swore to us. Thereupon we were
clapped into jail, where we now lie.</p>

<p>'Hon'd Sir: Humphrey, I am sorry to write, is much cast
down, not because he dreads death, which he doth not, any more
than to lie upon his bed; but because he hath, he says, drawn so
many to their ruin. He numbers me among those&mdash;though, indeed,
it was none of his doing, but by my own free will, that I entered
upon this business, which, contrary to reasonable expectation, hath
turned out so ill. Wherefore, dear Sir, since there is no one in
the world whose opinion and counsel Humphrey so greatly considers
as your own, I pray you, of your goodness, send him some
words of consolation and cheer.'</p>

<p>'That will I, right readily,' said Sir Christopher. 'At least the
poor lad cannot accuse himself of dragging me into the Clink.'</p>

<p>'I hear,' continued Robin's letter, 'that my mother hath gone
with Mr. Boscorel to London, to learn if aught can be done for us.
If she do not return before we are finished, bid her think kindly of
Humphrey and not to lay these things to his charge. As for my
dear girl, my Alice, I hear nothing of her. Miss Blake, who led
the Maids when they gave the flags to the Duke, is, I hear, clapped
into prison. Alice is not spoken of. I am greatly perturbed in
spirit concerning her, and I would gladly, if that might be compassed,
have speech with her before I die. I fear she will grieve
and weep; but not more than I myself at leaving her, poor maid!
I hear, also, nothing concerning her father, who was red-hot for
the Cause, and therefore, I fear, will not be passed over or forgotten.
Nor do I hear aught of Barnaby, who, I hope, hath
escaped on shipboard, as he said that he should do if things went
ajar. Where are they all? The roads are covered with rough
men, and it is not fit for such as Alice and her mother to be
travelling. I hope that they have returned in safety to Bradford
Orcas, and that my old master, Dr. Eykin, hath forgotten his zeal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
for the Protestant Duke, and is already seated again among his
books. If that is so, tell Alice, Honoured Sir, that there is no
hour of the day or night but I think of her continually; that the
chief pang of my approaching fate is the thought that I shall leave
her in sorrow, and that I cannot say or do anything to stay her
sorrow. Comfort her I cannot, save with words which will come
better from the saintly lips of her father. I again pray thee to
assure her of my faithful love. Tell her that the recollection of
her sweet face and steadfast eyes fills me with so great a longing
that I would fain die at once so as to bring nearer the moment
when we shall be able to sit together in heaven. My life hath
been glorified, if I may say so in humility, by her presence in my
heart, which drove away all common and unclean things. Of such
strength is earthly love. Nay, I could not, I now perceive, be
happy even with the joys of heaven if she were not by my side.
Where is she, my heart, my love? Pray God, she is in safety.</p>

<p>'And now, Sir, I have no more to say: The prison is a hot
and reeking place; at night it is hard to bear the foulness and the
stench of it. Humphrey says that we may shortly expect some
jail fever or small-pox to break out among us, in which case the
work of the Judges may be lightened. The good people of this
ancient city are in no way afraid of the King's vindictiveness, but
send in of their bounty quantity of provisions&mdash;fruit, eggs, fresh
meat, salted meat, ale, and cider&mdash;every day for the poor prisoners,
which shows which way their opinions do lean, even although the
clergy are against us. Honoured Sir, I am sure and certain that
the miscarriage of our enterprise was caused by the conduct of
those who had us in hand. In a year or two there shall be seen
(but not by us) another uprising; under another leader with
another end.</p>

<p>'So no more. I send to thee, dear and Honoured Sir, my
bounden duty and my grateful thanks for all that I owe to your
tender care and affection. Pray my mother, for me, to mourn no
more for me than is becoming to one of her piety and virtue.</p>

<p>'Alas! it is thinking upon her, and upon my poor lost Alice,
that my heart is wellnigh torn in pieces. But (tell Humphrey)
through no fault&mdash;no&mdash;through no fault of his.</p>

<p>'From thy dutiful and obedient grandson,&mdash;</p>

<p class="sig">
'R. C.'
</p>

<p>I read this all through. Then I folded up the letter and returned
it to Sir Christopher. As he took it the tears came into his
dear and venerable eyes and rolled down his cheeks.</p>

<p>'My dear&mdash;my dear,' he said, 'it is hard to bear. Everyone
who is dear to thee will go; there is an end of all; unless some
way, of which we know nothing, be opened unto us.'</p>

<p>'Why,' I said, 'if we were all dead and buried, and our souls
together in heaven'&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>'Patience, my dear,' said the old man.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span></p>

<p>'Oh! must they all die&mdash;all? My heart will burst! Oh! Sir,
will not one suffice for all? Will they not take me and hang me,
and let the rest go free?'</p>

<p>'Child,' he took my hand between his own, 'God knows that if
one life would suffice for all, it should be mine. Nay, I would
willingly die ten times over to save thy Robin for thee. He is not
dead yet, however. Nor is he sentenced. There are so many involved
that we may hope for a large measure of mercy. Nay,
more. His mother hath gone to London, as he says in his letter,
with my son-in-law, Philip Boscorel, to see if aught can be done,
even to the selling of my whole estate, to procure the enlargement
of the boys. I know not if anything can be done, but be assured
Philip Boscorel will leave no stone unturned.'</p>

<p>'Oh! can money buy a pardon? I have two hundred gold
pieces. They are Barnaby's'&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>'Then, my dear, they must be used to buy pardon for Barnaby
and thy father&mdash;though I doubt whether any pardon need be
bought for one who is brought so low.'</p>

<p>Beside the bed my mother sat crouched, watching his white
face as she had done all day long in our hiding-place. I think she
heeded nothing that went on around her, being wrapped in her
hopes and prayers for the wounded man.</p>

<p>Then Sir Christopher kissed me gently on the forehead.</p>

<p>'They say the King is unforgiving, my dear. Expect not,
therefore, anything. Say to thyself, every morning, that all must
die. To know the worst brings with it something of consolation.
Robin must die; Humphrey must die; your brother Barnaby
must die; your father&mdash;but he is wellnigh dead already&mdash;and I
myself, all must die upon the scaffold if we escape this noisome
jail. In thinking of this, remember who will be left. My dear, if
thou art as a widow and yet a maiden, I charge thee solemnly that
thou forget thine own private griefs and minister to those who will
have none but thee to help them. Live not for thyself, but to
console and solace those who, like thyself bereaved, will need thy
tender cares.'</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVII.</h2>

<h3>BEFORE THE ASSIZE.</h3>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 239px;">
<img src="images/i_202.jpg" width="239" height="350" alt="When" />
</div>

<p>Then we sat down and waited.
'Twas all that we could
do. Day after day we
went to the prison, where
my mother sat by my
father, whose condition
never changed in the least,
being always that of one
who slept, or, if his eyes
were open, was unconscious,
and though he
might utter a few rambling
words, had no command
of his mind or of
his speech. Wherefore we
hoped that he suffered
nothing. ''Twas a musket
ball had struck,' the surgeon
said, 'in his backbone
between the shoulders,
whereby his powers
of motion and of thought
were suspended.' I know
not whether anyone attempted to remove
the ball, or whether it was lodged there
at all, because I am ignorant of such
matters; and to me, whether he had been
struck in the back or no, it was to my
mind sure and certain that the Lord had granted my father's
earnest prayer that he should again be permitted to deliver openly
the message that was upon his soul; nay, had given him three
weeks of continual and faithful preaching, the fruits of which, could
we perceive them, should be abundant. That prayer granted, the
Lord, I thought, was calling him to rest. Therefore, I looked for
no improvement.</p>

<p>One other letter came from Robin, inclosing one for me, with
which (because I could not leave my mother at such a time) I was
forced to stay my soul, as the lover in the Canticle stayeth his soul<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
with apples. I have that letter still; it hath been with me always;
it lay hanging from my neck in the little leathern bag in which I
carried the Duke's ring; I read it again and again until I knew it
by heart; yet still I read it again, because even to look at my
lover's writing had in it something of comfort even when things
were at their worst, and Egyptian darkness lay upon my soul. But
this letter I cannot endure to copy out or suffer others to read it,
because it was written for mine own eye in such a time of trouble.
'Oh! my love!' he said. 'Oh, my tender heart!' and then a
hundred prayers for my happiness, and tears for my tears, and
hopes for the future (which would be not the earthly life but the
future reserved by merciful Heaven for those who have been called
and chosen). As for the sharp and painful passage by which we
must travel from this world to the next, Robin bade me take no
thought of that at all, but to think of him either as my lover
walking with me as of old beside the stream at home, or as a spirit
waiting for me to join him in the heavenly choir. And so ending
with as many farewells (the letter being written when he expected
the Judges to arrive and the Assize to begin) as showed his tender
love for me. No&mdash;I cannot write down this letter for the eyes of
all to read. There are things which must be kept hidden in our
own hearts; and, without doubt, every woman to whom good fortune
hath given a lover such as Robin, with a heart as fond and a
pen as ready (though he could never, like Humphrey, write sweet
verses), hath received an epistle or two like unto mine for its love
and tenderness, but (I hope) without the sadness of impending death.</p>

<p>It was four weeks after we were brought to Ilminster that the
news came to us of the coming trials. There were five Judges&mdash;but
the world knows but of one, namely, George Lord Jeffreys,
Chief Justice of England&mdash;and now, indeed, we began to understand
the true misery of our situation. For everyone knew the
character of the Judge, who, though a young man still, was already
the terror alike of prisoners, witnesses, and juries. It promised
to be a black and bloody Assize indeed, since this man was to be
the Judge.</p>

<p>The aspect of the prison by this time was changed. The songs
and merriment, the horseplay and loud laughter by which the men
had at first endeavoured to keep up their hearts were gone. The
country lads pined and languished in confinement; their cheeks
grew pale and their eyes heavy. Then, the prison was so crowded
that there was barely room for all to lie at night, and the yard was
too small for all to walk therein by day. In the morning, though
they opened all the shutters, the air was so foul that in going into
it from the open one felt sick and giddy, and was sometimes fain to
run out and drink cold water. Oh! the terrible place for an old
man such as Sir Christopher! Yet he endured without murmuring
the foulness and the hardness, comforting the sick, still reproving
blasphemies, and setting an example of cheerfulness. The
wounded men all died, I believe; which, as the event proved, was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
lucky for them. It would have saved the rest much suffering if
they had all died as well. And to think that this was only one of
many prisons thus crowded with poor captives! At Wells, Philip's
Norton, Shepton Mallet, Bath, Bridgwater, Taunton, Ilchester,
Somerton, Langport, Bristol and Exeter, there was a like assemblage
of poor wretches thus awaiting their trials.</p>

<p>I said that there was now little singing. There was, however,
drinking enough, and more than enough. They drank to drown
their sorrows, and to forget the horrid place in which they lay and
the future which awaited them. When they were drunk they
would bellow some of their old songs; but the brawling of a
drunkard will not communicate to his companions the same joy
as the music of a merry heart.</p>

<p>While we were expecting to hear that the Judge had arrived at
Salisbury, the fever broke out in the prison of Ilminster. At
Wells they were afflicted with the small-pox, but at Ilminster it
was jail fever which fell upon the poor prisoners. Everybody hath
heard of this terrible disorder, which is communicated by those who
have it to those who go among them&mdash;namely, to the warders and
turnkeys, and even to the judges and the juries. On the first day
after it broke out&mdash;which was with an extraordinary virulence&mdash;four
poor men died and were buried the next morning. After this,
no day passed but there were funerals at the churchyard, and the
mounds of their graves&mdash;the graves of these poor countrymen who
thought to fight the battles of the Lord&mdash;stood side by side in a
long row, growing continually longer. We&mdash;that is, good Mrs.
Prior and myself&mdash;sat at the window and watched the funerals,
praying for the safety of those we loved.</p>

<p>So great was the fear of infection in the town that no one was
henceforth allowed within the prison, nor were the warders
allowed to come out of it. This was a sad order for me, because
my mother chose to remain within the prison, finding a garret at
the house of the Chief Constable, and I could no longer visit that
good old man, Sir Christopher, whose only pleasure left had been
to converse with me daily, and, as I now understand, by the refreshment
the society of youth brings to age, to lighten the tedium of
his imprisonment.</p>

<p>Henceforth, therefore, I went to the prison door every morning
and sent in my basket of provisions, but was not suffered to enter;
and though I could have speech with my mother or with Barnaby,
they were on one side the bars and I on the other.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 420px;">
<img src="images/i_205.jpg" width="420" height="600" alt="wicket" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">'<i>I was standing at the wicket waiting for my basket to be taken in.</i>'</p></div>
</div>

<p>It was at this time that I made the acquaintance of Mr. George
Penne. This creature&mdash;a villain, as I afterwards discovered, of
the deepest dye&mdash;was to external appearance a grave and sober
merchant. He was dressed in brown cloth and laced shirt, and
carried a gold-headed stick in his hand. He came to Ilminster
about the end of August or the beginning of September, and began
to inquire particularly into the names and the circumstances of the
prisoners, pretending (such was his craftiness) a great tenderness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
for their welfare. He did the same thing, we heard afterwards,
wherever the Monmouth prisoners were confined. At Ilminster,
the fever being in the jail, he did not venture within, but stood
outside and asked of any who seemed to know, who were the
prisoners within, and what were their circumstances.</p>

<p>He accosted me one morning when I was standing at the wicket
waiting for my basket to be taken in.</p>

<p>'Madam,' he said, 'you are doubtless a friend of some poor
prisoner. Your father or your brother may unhappily be lying
within?'</p>

<p>Now I was grown somewhat cautious by this time. Wherefore,
fearing some kind of snare or trap, I replied gravely, that such,
indeed, might be the case.</p>

<p>'Then, Madam,' he said, speaking in a soft voice and looking
full of compassion, 'if that be so, suffer me, I pray you, to wish
him a happy deliverance; and this, indeed, from the bottom of my
heart.'</p>

<p>'Sir,' I said, moved by the earnestness of his manner, 'I know
not who you may be, but I thank you. Such a wish, I hope, will
not procure you the reward of a prison. Sir, I wish you a good
day.'</p>

<p>So he bowed and left me, and passed on.</p>

<p>But next day I found him in the same place. And his eyes
were more filled with compassion than before and his voice was
softer.</p>

<p>'I cannot sleep, Madam,' he said, 'for thinking of these poor
prisoners; I hear that among them is none other than Sir Christopher
Challis, a gentleman of great esteem and well stricken in
years. And there is also the pious and learned&mdash;but most unfortunate&mdash;Dr.
Comfort Eykin, who rode with the army and
preached daily, and is now, I hear, grievously wounded and bedridden.'</p>

<p>'Sir,' I said, 'Dr. Comfort Eykin is my father. It is most
true that he is a prisoner, and that he is wounded.'</p>

<p>He heaved a deep sigh and wiped a tear from his eyes.</p>

<p>'It is now certain,' he said, 'that Lord Jeffreys will come down
to conduct the trials. Nay, it is reported that he has already
arrived at Salisbury, breathing fire and revenge, and that he hath
with him four other Judges and a troop of horse. What they will
do with so many prisoners I know not. I fear that it will go hard
with all; but, as happens in such cases, those who have money, and
know how to spend it, may speedily get their liberty.'</p>

<p>'How are they to spend it?'</p>

<p>'Why, Madam, it is not indeed to be looked for that you should
know. But when the time comes for the trial, should I, as will
very likely happen, be in the way, send for me, and whatever the
sentence I warrant we shall find a way to 'scape it&mdash;even if it be a
sentence of death. Send for me&mdash;my name is George Penne, and
I am a well-known merchant of Bristol.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span></p>

<p>It was then that Barnaby came to the other side of the wicket.
We could talk, but could not touch each other.</p>

<p>'All is well, Sis,' he said: 'Dad is neither better nor worse,
and Sir Christopher is hearty, though the prison is like the 'tween
decks of a ship with Yellow Jack aboard&mdash;just as sweet and
pleasant for the air and just as merry for the crew.'</p>

<p>'Barnaby,' I said, 'the Judges are now at Salisbury.'</p>

<p>'Ay, ay; I thought they would have been there before. We
shall be tried, they tell me, at Wells, which it is thought will be
taken after other towns. So there is still a tidy length of rope.
Sis, this continual smoking of tobacco to keep off infection doth
keep a body dry. Cider will serve, but let it be a runlet, at least.'</p>

<p>'He called you "Sister," Madam,' said Mr. Penne curiously.
'Have you brother as well as father in this place?'</p>

<p>'Alas! Sir, I have not only my father, my mother, and my
brother in this place, but my father-in-law (as I hoped soon to call
him); and in Exeter Jail is my lover and his cousin. Oh! Sir, if
you mean honestly'&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>'Madam'&mdash;he laid his hand upon his breast&mdash;'I assure you I
am all honesty. I have no other thought, I swear to you, than to
save, if possible, the lives of these poor men.'</p>

<p>He walked with me to my lodging, and I there told him not
only concerning our own people, but also all that I knew of the
prisoners in this jail&mdash;they were for the most part poor and humble
men. He made notes in a book, which caused me some misgivings;
but he assured me again and again that all he desired was to save
their lives. And I now understand that he spoke the truth indeed,
but not the whole truth.</p>

<p>'Your brother, for instance,' he said. 'Oh! Madam, 'twere
a thousand pities that so brave a young man, so stout withal, should
be hanged, drawn, and quartered. And your lover at Exeter,
doubtless a tall and proper youth; and the other whom you
have named, Dr. Humphrey Challis, and your grandfather (as I
hope he will be) Sir Christopher; and your own father&mdash;why,
Madam,' he grew quite warm upon it, 'if you will but furnish some
honest merchant&mdash;I say not myself, because I know not yet if you
would trust me&mdash;but some honest merchant with the necessary
moneys, I will engage that they shall all be saved from hanging.
To be sure, these are all captains and officers, and to get their
absolute pardon will be a great matter&mdash;perhaps above your means.
Yet, Sir Christopher hath a good estate, I am told.'</p>

<p>This George Penne was, it is true, a Bristol merchant, engaged
in the West India trade; that is to say, he bought sugar and tobacco,
and had shares in ships which sailed to and from Bristol
and the West Indies, and sometimes made voyages to the Guinea
Coast for negroes. But, in common with many Bristol merchants,
he had another trade, and a very profitable trade it is, namely,
what is called kidnapping: that is, buying or otherwise securing
criminals who have been pardoned or reprieved on condition of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
going to the Plantations. They sell these wretches for a term of
years to the planters, and make a great profit by the transaction.
And, foreseeing that there would presently be a rare abundance of
such prisoners, the honest Mr. George Penne was going from prison
to prison finding out what persons of substance there were who
would willingly pay for their sentence to be thus mitigated. In
the event, though things were not ordered exactly as he could
have wished, this worthy man (his true worth you shall presently
hear) made a pretty penny, as the saying is, out of the prisoners.
What he made out of us, and by what lies, you shall learn; but,
by ill-fortune for him, he gat not the fingering of the great sums
which he hoped of us.</p>

<p>And now the news&mdash;from Winchester first, and from Dorchester
afterwards&mdash;filled the hearts of all with a dismay which it is beyond
all power of words to tell. For if an ancient lady of good repute
(though the widow of a regicide), such a woman as Lady Lisle,
seventy years of age, could be condemned to be burned&mdash;and was,
in fact, beheaded&mdash;for no greater offence than harbouring two
rebels, herself ignorant of who they were or whence they came,
what could any hope who had actually borne arms? And, again,
at Dorchester, thirty who pleaded not guilty were found guilty and
condemned to be hanged, and nearly three hundred who pleaded
guilty were sentenced to be hanged at the same time. It was not
an idle threat intended to terrify the rest, because thirteen of the
number were executed on the following Monday, and eighty afterwards.
Among those who were first hanged were many whom we
knew. The aged and pious Mr. Sampson Larke, the Baptist Minister
of Lyme, for instance, was one; Colonel Holmes (whom the
King had actually pardoned) was another; and young Mr. Hewling&mdash;whose
case was like that of Robin. This terrible news caused
great despondency and choking in the prison, where also the fever
daily carried off one or two.</p>

<p>Oh! my poor heart fell, and I almost lost the power of prayer,
when I heard that from Dorchester the Judge was riding in great
state, driving his prisoners before him to Exeter, where there were
two hundred waiting their trial. And among them Robin&mdash;Alas!
alas!&mdash;my Robin.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVIII.</h2>

<h3>BENJAMIN.</h3>


<div class="drop">
<img src="images/i_210.jpg" alt="I" width="100" height="99" class="cap" />
 <p class="cap_1">I t was the evening of September the Sixteenth, about
nine of the clock. I was sitting alone in my lodging.
Downstairs I heard the voice of the poor widow, Mrs.
Prior, who had received us. She was praying aloud
with some godly friends for the safety of her sons.
These young men, as I have said, were never more heard of, and
were therefore already, doubtless, past praying for. I, who ought
to have been praying with them, held Robin's last letter in my
hands. I knew it by heart; but I must still be reading it again
and again; thinking it was his voice which was indeed speaking to
me, trying to feel his presence near me, to hear his breath, to see
his very eyes. In the night, waking or sleeping, I still would hear
him calling to me aloud. 'My heart! my life! my love!' he would
cry. I heard him, I say, quite plainly. By special mercy and
grace this power was accorded to me; because I have no doubt that
in his mind, while lying in his noisome prison, he did turn his
thoughts, yea, and the yearnings of his fond heart, to the maid he
loved. But now the merciless Judge who had sentenced three
hundred men to one common doom&mdash;three hundred men!&mdash;was
such a sentence ever known?&mdash;had left Dorchester, and was already,
perhaps, at Exeter. Oh!&mdash;perhaps Robin had by this time stood
his trial: what place was left for prayer? For if the poor, ignorant
clowns were condemned to death, how much more the gentlemen,
the officers of Monmouth's army! Perhaps he was already executed&mdash;my
lover, my boy, my Robin!&mdash;taken out and hanged, and
now a cold and senseless corpse! Then the wailings and prayers
of the poor woman below, added to the distraction of these thoughts,
made me feel as if I was indeed losing my senses. At this time, it
was blow upon blow&mdash;line upon line. The sky was black&mdash;the
heavens were deaf. Is there&mdash;can there be&mdash;a more miserable
thing than to feel that the very heavens are deaf? The mercy of
the Lord&mdash;His kindly hearkening to our cries and prayers&mdash;these
we believe as we look for the light of day and the warmth of the
sun. Nay, this belief is the very breath of our life; so that there
is none but the most hardened and abandoned sinner who doth not
still feel that he hath in the Lord a Father as well as a Judge. To
lose that belief&mdash;'twere better to be a lump of senseless clay. The
greatest misery of the lost soul, even greater than his continual<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
torment of fire, and his never-ending thirst, and the gnawing of
remorse, must be to feel that the heavens are deaf to his prayers&mdash;deaf
for ever and for ever!</p>
</div>

<p>At this time, my prayers were all for safety. 'Safety, good
Lord! give them safety! Save them from the executioner? Give
them safety?' Thus, as Barnaby said, the shipwrecked mariner
clinging to the mast asks not for a green, pleasant, and fertile
shore, but for land&mdash;only for land. I sat there, musing sadly, the
Bible on the table and a lighted candle. I read not in the Bible,
but listened to the wailing of the poor soul below, and looked at
the churchyard without, the moonlight falling upon the fresh
mounds which covered the graves of the poor dead prisoners.
Suddenly I heard a voice&mdash;a loud and harsh voice&mdash;and footsteps.
I knew both footsteps and voice, and I sprang to my feet trembling,
because I was certain that some new disaster had befallen us.</p>

<p>Then the steps mounted the stairs; the door was opened, and
Benjamin&mdash;none other than Benjamin&mdash;appeared. What did he
here? He was so big, with so red a face, that his presence seemed
to fill the room. And with him&mdash;what did this mean?&mdash;came
Madam herself, who I thought to have been at Exeter. Alas! her
eyes were red with weeping; her cheeks were thin and wasted
with sorrow; her lips were trembling.</p>

<p>'Alice!' she cried, holding out her hands. 'Child, these
terrible things are done, and yet we live! Alas! we live! Are
our hearts made of stone that we still live? As for me, I cannot
die, though I lose all&mdash;all&mdash;all!'</p>

<p>'Dear Madam, what hath happened? More misery! More
disaster! Oh! tell me! tell me!'</p>

<p>'Oh! my dear, they have been tried&mdash;they have been tried,
and they are condemned to die&mdash;both Robin&mdash;my son Robin&mdash;and
with him Humphrey, who dragged him into the business and alone
ought to suffer for both. But there is now no justice in the land.
No&mdash;no more justice can be had. Else Humphrey should have
suffered for all.'</p>

<p>There was something strange in her eyes&mdash;she did not look like
a mother robbed of her children; she gazed upon me as if there
was something else upon her mind. As if the condemnation of
her son was not enough.</p>

<p>'Robin will be hanged,' she went on. 'He hath been the only
comfort of my life since my husband was taken from me, when he
was left an infant in my arms. Robin will be hanged like any
common gipsy caught stealing a sheep. He will be hanged, and
drawn and quartered, and those goodly limbs of his will be stuck
upon poles for all to see!'</p>

<p>Truly I looked for nothing less. Barnaby bade me look for
nothing less than this; but at the news I fell into a swoon. So
one who knoweth beforehand that he is to feel the surgeon's knife,
and thinks to endure the agony without a cry, is fain to shriek and
scream when the moment comes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span></p>

<p>When I recovered I was sitting at the open window, Madam
applying a wet cloth to my forehead.</p>

<p>'Have no fear,' Benjamin was saying. 'She will do what you
command her, so only that he may go free.'</p>

<p>'Is there no way but that?' she asked.</p>

<p>'None!' And then he swore a great oath.</p>

<p>My eyes being opened and my sense returned, I perceived that
Mrs. Prior was also in the room. And I wondered (in such
moments the mind finds relief in trifles) that Benjamin's face
should have grown so red and his cheeks so fat.</p>

<p>'Thou hast been in a swoon, my dear,' said Madam. 'But 'tis past.'
'Why is Benjamin here?' I asked.</p>

<p>He looked at Madam, who cast down her eyes, I knew not why.</p>

<p>'Benjamin is now our only friend,' she replied without looking
up. 'It is out of his kindness&mdash;yes&mdash;his kindness of heart that
he hath come.'</p>

<p>'I do not understand. If Robin is to die what kindness can
he show?'</p>

<p>'Tell her, Benjamin,' said Madam, 'tell her of the trials at
Exeter.'</p>

<p>'His Lordship came to Exeter,' Benjamin began, 'on the
evening of September the Thirteenth, escorted by many country
gentlemen and a troop of horse. I had the honour of riding with
him. The trials began the day before yesterday, the Fourteenth.'</p>

<p>'Pray, good Sir,' asked the poor woman who had lost her sons,
'did you observe my boys among the prisoners?'</p>

<p>'How the devil should I know your boys?' he replied, turning
upon her roughly, so that she asked no more questions. 'If they
were rebels they deserve hanging'&mdash;here she shrieked aloud, and
fled the room. 'The trials began with two fellows who pleaded
"Not guilty," but were quickly proved to have been in arms, and
were condemned to death, one of them being sent out to instant
execution. The rest who were brought up that day&mdash;among whom
were Robin and Humphrey&mdash;pleaded "Guilty," being partly
terrified and partly persuaded that it was their only chance of
escape. So they, too, were condemned&mdash;two hundred and forty in
all&mdash;every man Jack of them, to be hanged, drawn, and quartered,
and their limbs to be afterwards stuck on poles for the greater
terror of evildoers'&mdash;he said these words with such a fire in his
eyes, and in such a dreadful threatening voice, as made me tremble.
'Then they were all taken back to jail, where they will lie until
the day of execution, and the Lord have mercy upon their souls!'</p>

<p>The terrible Judge Jeffreys himself could not look more terrible
than Benjamin when he uttered the prayer with which a sentence
to death is concluded.</p>

<p>'Benjamin, were you in the court to see and hear the condemnation
of your own cousins?'</p>

<p>'I was. I sat in the body of the court, in the place reserved
for Counsel.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span></p>

<p>'Could you say nothing that would help them?'</p>

<p>'Nothing. Not a word from anyone could help them. Consider&mdash;one
of them was an officer, and one a surgeon in the army.
The ignorant rustics whom they led may some of them escape, but
the officers can look for no mercy.'</p>

<p>'Madam,' I cried, 'I must see Robin before he dies; though,
God knows, there are those here who want my services daily. Yet
I must see Robin. He will not die easy unless he can see me and
kiss me once.'</p>

<p>Madam made no reply.</p>

<p>'For a week,' said Benjamin, 'they are safe. I do not think
they will be executed for a week at least. But it is not wise to
reckon on a reprieve even for an hour: the Judge may at any
time order their execution.'</p>

<p>'I will go to-morrow.'</p>

<p>'That will be seen,' said Benjamin.</p>

<p>'My dear,' said Madam, 'my nephew Benjamin is a friend of
the Judge, Lord Jeffreys.'</p>

<p>'Say rather a follower and admirer of that great, learned, and
religious man. One who is yet but a member of the Outer Bar
must not assume the style and title of friend to a man whose next
step must be the Woolsack.'</p>

<p>'Heavens! He called the inhuman wretch who had sentenced
an innocent old woman of seventy to be burned alive, and five
hundred persons to be hanged, and one knows not how many to be
inhumanly flogged&mdash;great and religious!'</p>

<p>'If interest can save any,' Madam said softly, 'Benjamin can
command that interest, and he is on the side of mercy, especially
where his cousins are concerned.'</p>

<p>I now observed that Madam, who had not formerly been wont
to regard her nephew with much affection, behaved towards him
with the greatest respect and submission.</p>

<p>'Madam,' he replied, 'you know the goodness of my heart.
What man can do shall be done by me, not only for Robin, but for
the others who are involved with him in common ruin. But there
are conditions with which I have taken pains to acquaint you.'</p>

<p>Madam sighed heavily, and looked as if she would speak, but
refrained; and I saw the tears rolling down her cheeks.</p>

<p>'What conditions, Benjamin?' I asked him. 'Conditions for
trying to save your own cousins and your own grandfather! Conditions?
Why, you should be moving heaven and earth for them
instead of making conditions.'</p>

<p>'It needs not so much exertion,' he replied with an unbecoming
grin. 'First, Alice, I must own, Child, that the two years or
thereabouts since I saw thee last have added greatly to thy
charms; at which I rejoice.'</p>

<p>'Oh! what have my charms to do with the business?'</p>

<p>'Much; as thou wilt presently discover. But let me remind
you both that there threaten&mdash;nay, there are actually overhanging<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
&mdash;disasters, the like of which never happen save in time of civil
war and of rebellion. My grandfather is in prison, and will be
tried on a charge of sending men and horses to join Monmouth.
Nay, the Duke's Proclamation was found in his house; he will be
certainly condemned and his estates confiscated. So there will be
an end of as old a family as lives in Somerset. Then there is thy
father, Child, who was Preacher to the army, and did make mischief
in stirring up the fanatical zeal of many. Think you that he
can escape? Then there is thy brother Barnaby, who was such a
fool as to meddle in what concerned him not, and now will hang
therefor. What can we expect? Are men to go unpunished who
thus rebel against the Lord's anointed? Is treason&mdash;rank treason&mdash;the
setting up of a Pretender Prince (who is now lying headless
in his coffin) as the rightful heir, to be forgiven? We must not
look for it. Alas! Madam, had I been with you instead of that
conceited, fanatical, crookback Humphrey, whom I did ever detest,
none of these things should have happened.'</p>

<p>'Humphrey,' I said, 'has more worth in one finger than you in
all your great body, Benjamin.'</p>

<p>'My dear, my dear, do not anger Benjamin. Oh, do not anger
our only friend!'</p>

<p>'She may say what she pleases. My time will come. Listen
then. They must all be hanged unless I can succeed in getting
them pardoned.'</p>

<p>'Nay&mdash;but&mdash;forgive my rudeness, Benjamin; they are your
own cousins&mdash;it is your own grandfather. What need of conditions?
Oh! what does this mean? Are you a man of flesh and blood?'</p>

<p>'My conditions, Child'&mdash;why did he laugh?&mdash;'will assure you
that such is truly the nature of my composition.'</p>

<p>'If money is wanted'&mdash;I thought of my bag of gold and of
Mr. Penne's hints&mdash;'how much will suffice?'</p>

<p>'I know not. If it comes to buying them off, more thousands
than could be raised on the Bradford Orcas estates. Put money
out of mind.'</p>

<p>'Then, Benjamin, save them if thou canst.'</p>

<p>'His Lordship knows that I have near relations concerned in
the Rebellion. Yet, he assured me if his own brothers were among
the prisoners he would hang them all.'</p>

<p>'Nay, then, Benjamin; I say no more. Tell me what are
these conditions, and, if we can grant or contrive them, we will
comply.' I had no thought of what was meant by his conditions,
nor did I even guess until the morning, when Madam told me.
'Oh! Madam, is there anything in the world&mdash;anything that we
would not do to save them?'</p>

<p>Madam looked at me with so much pity in her eyes that I
wondered. It was pity for me and not for her son that I read in
that look. Why did she pity me?</p>

<p>I understood not.</p>

<p>'My dear,' she said, 'there are times when women are called<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
upon to make sacrifices which they never thought to make, which
seem impossible to be even asked&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Oh! there are no sacrifices which we would not gladly make.
What can Benjamin require that we should not gladly do for him?
Nay, he is Robin's cousin, and your nephew, and Sir Christopher's
grandson. He will, if need be, join us in making these sacrifices.'</p>

<p>'I will,' said Benjamin&mdash;again, why did he laugh?&mdash;'I will
join you in making one sacrifice at least, with a willing heart.'</p>

<p>'I will tell her to-morrow,' said Madam. 'No, I cannot tell
her to-night. Let us first rest. Go, Sir; leave us to our sorrow.
It may be that we may yet think the sacrifice too great even for
the lives and the safety of those we love. Go, Sir, for to-night,
and return to-morrow.'</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>'Surely, Child,' said Madam presently, when he was gone, and
we were alone, 'we are the most unhappy women in the world.'</p>

<p>'Nay,' I replied. 'There have been other women before us
who have been ruined and widowed by civil wars and rebellions.
If it be any comfort to think that others have suffered like ourselves,
then we may comfort ourselves. But the thought brings no
consolation to me.'</p>

<p>'Hagar,' said Madam, 'was a miserable woman because she was
cast out by the man she loved, even the father of her son; but she
saved her son. Rachel was unhappy until the Lord gave her a son.
Jephthah's daughter was unhappy&mdash;my dear, there is no case
except hers which may be compared with ours&mdash;and Jephthah's
daughter was happy in one circumstance: that she was permitted
to die. Ah! happy girl, she died! That was all her sacrifice&mdash;to
die for the sake of her father! But what is ours?'</p>

<p>So she spoke in riddles or dark sayings, of which I understood
nothing. Nevertheless, before lying down, I did solemnly and,
in her presence and hearing, aloud, upon my knees, offer unto
Almighty God myself&mdash;my very life&mdash;if so that Robin could be
saved. And then, with lighter heart than I had known for long, I
lay down and slept.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>At midnight, or thereabouts, Madam woke me up.</p>

<p>'Child,' she said, 'I cannot sleep. Tell me truly: is there
nothing that thou wouldest refuse for Robin's sake?'</p>

<p>'Nothing, verily! Ah, Madam, can you doubt it?'</p>

<p>'Even if it were a sacrifice of which he would not approve?'</p>

<p>'Believe me, Madam, there is nothing that I would not do for
Robin's safety.'</p>

<p>'Child, if we were living in the days of persecution wouldest
thou hear the Mass and adopt the Catholic religion to save thy
lover's life?'</p>

<p>'Oh, Madam, the Lord will never try us above our strength!'</p>

<p>'Sleep, my child, sleep; and pray that, as thy temptation, so
may be thy strength!'</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIX.</h2>

<h3>ON WHAT CONDITIONS?</h3>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 254px;">
<img src="images/i_216.jpg" width="254" height="350" alt="In" />
</div>

<p>In the morning I awoke with a
lighter heart than I had
known for a long time.
Benjamin was going to release
our prisoners! I
should go to meet Robin
at the gate of his prison.
All would be well, except
that my father would never
recover. We should return
to the village and everything
would go on as before. Oh!
poor fond wretch! how was I deluded!
and, oh! miserable day
that ended with such shame and
sadness, yet began with so much
hope.</p>

<p>Madam was already dressed.
She was sitting at the window
looking into the churchyard. She
had been crying. Alas! how many
women in Somersetshire were then
weeping all day long!</p>

<p>'Madam,' I said, 'we now have
hope. We must not weep and lament
any more. Oh! to have at last a little hope&mdash;when we have
lived so long in despair&mdash;it makes one breathe again. Benjamin
will save our prisoners for us. Oh! after all, it is Benjamin
who will help us. We did not use to love Benjamin, because he
was rude and masterful and wanted everything for himself and
would never give up anything. Yet, you see, he had, after all, a
good heart.' Madam groaned. 'And he cannot forget, though he
followeth not his grandfather's opinions, that he is his Honour's
grandson&mdash;the son of his only daughter&mdash;and your nephew, and
first cousin to Robin, and second cousin once removed to Humphrey
and Barnaby; playfellows of old. Why, these are ties which bind
him as if with ropes! He needs must bestir himself to save their
lives. And since he says that he can save them, of course he must<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
have bestirred himself to some purpose. Weep no more, dear
Madam; your son will be restored to us! We shall be happy
again&mdash;thanks to Benjamin!'</p>

<p>'Child,' she replied, 'my heart is broken! It is broken, I
say! Oh, to be lying dead and at peace in yonder churchyard!
Never before did I think that it must be a happy thing to be dead
and at rest, and to feel nothing and to know nothing!'</p>

<p>'But, Madam, the dead are not in their graves. There lie only
the bodies. Their souls are above.'</p>

<p>'Then they still think and remember. Oh! can a time ever
come when things can be forgotten? Will the dead ever cease to
reproach themselves?'</p>

<p>She wrung her hands in an ecstasy of grief, though I knew not
what should move her so. Indeed, she was commonly a woman of
sober and contained disposition, entirely governed both in her
temper and her words. What was in her mind that she should
accuse herself? Then, while I was dressing, she went on talking,
being still full of this strong passion.</p>

<p>'I shall have my boy back again,' she said. 'Yes; he will
come back to me. And what will he say to me when I tell him
all? Yet I <i>must</i> have him back. Oh! to think of the hangman
tying the rope about his neck'&mdash;she shuddered and trembled&mdash;'and
afterwards the cruel knife'&mdash;she clasped her hands and could
not say the words&mdash;'I see the comely limbs of my boy. Oh! the
thought tears my heart&mdash;it tears me through and through. I cannot
think of anything else day or night. And yet in the prison he is
so patient and so cheerful. I marvel that men can be so patient
with this dreadful death before them.' She broke out again into
another passion of sobbing and crying. Then she became calmer,
and tried to speak of things less dreadful.</p>

<p>'When first I visited my boy in prison,' she said, 'Humphrey
came humbly to ask my pardon. Poor lad! I have had hard
thoughts of him. It is certain that he was in the plot from the
beginning. Yet had he not gone so far, should we have sat down
when the rising began? But he doth still accuse himself of rashness
and calls himself the cause of all our misfortunes. He fell
upon his knees, in the sight of all, to ask forgiveness, saying that
it was he and none other who had brought ruin upon us all. Then
Robin begged me to raise him up and comfort him, which I did,
putting aside my hard thoughts and telling him that, being such
stubborn Protestants, our lads could not choose but join the Duke,
whether he advised it or whether he did not. Nay, I told him
that Robin would have dragged him willy nilly. And so I kissed
him, and Robin took him by the hand and solemnly assured him
that his grandfather had no such thought in his mind.'</p>

<p>'Nay,' I said, 'my father and Barnaby would certainly have
joined the Duke, Humphrey or not. Never were any men more
eager for rebellion.'</p>

<p>'I have been to London,' she went on. ''Tis a long journey<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
and I effected nothing; for the mind of the King, I was assured, is
harder than the nether millstone. My brother-in-law, Philip
Boscorel, went with me, and I left him there. But I have no hope
that he will be able to help us, his old friends being much scattered
and many of them dead, and some hostile to the Court and in ill-favour.
So I returned, seeing that, if I could not save my son I
could be with him until he died. The day before yesterday he was
tried&mdash;if you call that a trial when hundreds together plead guilty
and are all alike sentenced to death.'</p>

<p>'Have you seen him since the trial?'</p>

<p>'I went to the prison as soon as they were brought back from
Court. Some of the people&mdash;for they were all condemned to
death&mdash;every one&mdash;were crying and lamenting. And there were
many women among them&mdash;their wives or their mothers&mdash;and these
were shrieking and wringing their hands; so that it was a terrible
spectacle. But some of the men called for drink, and began to
carouse, so that they might drown the thought of impending death.
My dear, I never thought to look upon a scene so full of horror.
As for our own boys, Robin was patient and even cheerful; and
Humphrey, leading us to the most quiet spot in that dreadful place,
exhorted us to lose no time in weeping or vain laments, but to
cheer and console our hearts with the thought that death&mdash;even
violent death&mdash;is but a brief pang and life is but a short passage,
and that heaven awaits us beyond. Humphrey should have been
a godly minister, such is the natural piety and goodness of his
heart. So he spoke of the happy meeting in that place of blessedness
where earthly love would be purged of its grossness, and our
souls shall be so glorified that we shall each admire the beauty and
the excellence of the other. Then Robin talked of thee, my dear,
and sent thee a loving message bidding thee grieve for him, but not
without hope&mdash;and that a sure and certain hope&mdash;of meeting again.
There are other things he bade me tell thee; but now I cannot!&mdash;oh,
I must not!'</p>

<p>'Nay, Madam; but if they are words that he wished me to
hear'&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>'Why, they were of his constant love&mdash;and&mdash;no, I cannot tell
them!'</p>

<p>'Well,' I said, 'fret not thy poor heart with thinking any more
of the prison; for Benjamin will surely save him, and then we shall
love Benjamin all our lives.'</p>

<p>'He will, perhaps, save him. And yet'&mdash;&mdash;she turned her
head&mdash;'Oh, how can I tell <em>her</em>&mdash;we shall shed many more tears.
How can I tell <em>her</em>? How can I tell <em>her</em>?'</p>

<p>So she broke off again, but presently recovered and went on
talking. In time of great trouble the mind wanders backwards and
forwards, and though one talks still, it is disjointedly. So she went
back to the prison.</p>

<p>'The boys have been well, though the prison is full and the air
is foul. Yet there hath been as yet no fever, for which they are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
thankful. They had no money, the soldiers who took them
prisoners having robbed them of their money, and indeed stripped
them as well to their shirts, telling them that shirts were good
enough to be hanged in. Yet the people of Exeter have treated
the prisoners with great humanity, bringing them daily food and
drink, so that there has been nothing lacking. The time, however,
doth hang upon hands in a place where there is nothing to do all
day but to think of the past and to dread the future. One poor
prisoner I was told had gone distracted with the terror of this
thought. Child, every day that I visited my son, while he talked
with me, always cheerful and smiling, my mind turned continually
to the scaffold and the gibbet.' Then she returned to the old subject
from which she could in no way escape. 'I saw the hangman,
I saw my son hanging to the shameful tree&mdash;oh! my son! my son!&mdash;till
I could bear it no longer, and would hurry away from the prison
and walk about the town over the fields&mdash;yea, all night long&mdash;to
escape the dreadful thought. Oh! to be blessed with such a son
and to have him torn from my arms for such a death! If he had
been killed upon the field of battle 'twould have been easier to
bear. But now he dies daily&mdash;he dies a thousand deaths in my
mind. My child!'&mdash;she turned again to the churchyard&mdash;'the
rooks are cawing in their nests; the sparrows and the robins hop
among the graves; the dead hear nothing; all their troubles are
over, all their sins are forgiven.'</p>

<p>I comforted her as well as I could. Indeed, I understood not
at all what she meant, thinking that perhaps all her trouble had
caused her to be in that frame of mind when a woman doth not
know whether to laugh or to cry. And then, taking my basket, I
sallied forth to provide the day's provisions for my prisoners.</p>

<p>'Barnaby,' I said, when he came to the wicket, 'I have good
news for thee.'</p>

<p>'What good news? That I am to be flogged once a year in
every market-town in Somersetshire, as will happen to young
Tutchin?'</p>

<p>'No, no&mdash;not that kind of news, but freedom, Brother, hope
for freedom.'</p>

<p>He laughed. 'Who is to give us freedom?'</p>

<p>'Benjamin hath found a way for the enlargement of all.'</p>

<p>'Ben Boscorel? What! will he stir finger for the sake of anybody?
Then, Sis, if I remember Ben aright, there will be something
for himself. But if it is upon Ben that we are to rely we are truly
well sped. On Ben, quotha!'</p>

<p>'My Brother, he told me so himself.'</p>

<p>''Ware hawks, Sister. If Ben is a tone end of the rope and the
hangman at the other, I think I know who will be stronger. Well,
Child, believe Ben if thou wilt. Thy father looks strange this
morning. He opened his eyes and seemed to know me. I wonder
if there is a change. 'Tis wonderful how he lasts. There are six
men sickened since yesterday of the fever. Three of them brought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
in last week are already dead. As for the singing that we used to
hear, it is all over, and if the men get drunk they are dumb drunk.
Sir Christopher looks but poorly this morning. I hope he will not
take the fever. He staggered when he arose, which is a bad
sign.'</p>

<p>'Tell mother, Barnaby, what Benjamin hath undertaken to do.'</p>

<p>'Nay, that shall I not, because, look you, I believe it not.
There is some trick or lie at the bottom, unless Ben hath repented
and changed his disposition, which used to be two parts wolf, one part
bear, and the rest fox. If there were anything left it was serpent.
Well, Sister, I am no grumbler, but I expect this job to be over in
a fortnight or so, when they say the Wells Assizes will be held.
Then we shall all be swinging, and I only hope that we may carry
with us into the Court such a breath of jail fever as shall lay the
Judge himself upon his back and end his days. In the next world
he will meet the men whom he has sentenced, and it will fare worse
for him in their hands than with fifty thousand devils.'</p>

<p>So he took a drink of the beer, and departed within the prison.
And for many months I saw him no more.</p>

<p>On my way home I met Benjamin.</p>

<p>'Hath Madam told you yet of my conditions?' he asked eagerly.</p>

<p>'Not yet; she will doubtless tell me presently. Oh! what
matter for the conditions? It can only be something good for us,
contrived by your kind heart, Ben. I have told Barnaby, who will
not believe in our good fortune.'</p>

<p>'It is, indeed, something very good for you, Alice, as you will
find. Come with me and walk in the meadows beyond the reach
of this doleful place, where the air reeks with jail fever, and all day
long they are reading the Funeral Service.'</p>

<p>So he led me out upon the sloping sides of a hill, where we
walked a while upon the grass very pleasantly, my mind being now
at rest.</p>

<p>'You have heard of nothing,' he said, 'of late, but of the Rebellion
and its consequences. Let us talk about London.'</p>

<p>So he discoursed concerning his own profession and his prospects,
which, he said, were better than those of any other young lawyer,
in his own opinion. 'For my practice,' he said, 'I already have
one which gives me an income far beyond my wants, which are
simple. Give me plain fare, and for the evening a bottle or two of
good wine, with tobacco, and friends who love a cheerful glass. I
ask no more. My course lies clear before me: I shall become a
King's Counsel, I shall be made a Judge; presently, I shall become
Lord Chancellor. What did I tell thee, Child, long ago? Well,
that time has now arrived.'</p>

<p>Still I was so foolish, being so happy, that I could not understand
what he meant.</p>

<p>'I am sure, Benjamin,' I said, 'that we at home shall ever
rejoice and be proud of your success. Nobody will be more happy
to hear of it than Robin and I.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span></p>

<p>Here he turned very red and muttered something.</p>

<p>'You find your happiness in courts and clubs and London,' I
went on; 'as for Robin and myself, we shall find ours in the peaceful
place which we have always decided to have.'</p>

<p>'What the Devil!' he cried, 'she will not tell you the conditions?
She came with me for no other purpose. I have borne with her
company all the way from Exeter for this only. Go back to her,
and ask what it is! Go back, I say, and make her tell! What!
am I to take all this trouble for nothing?'</p>

<p>His face became purple with sudden rage; his eyes grew swiftly
fierce, and he roared and bawled at me. Why, what had I said?</p>

<p>'Benjamin,' I cried, 'what is the matter? How have I angered
you?'</p>

<p>'Go back!' he roared again. 'Tell her that if I presently come
and find thee still in ignorance 'twill be the worse for all! Tell
her that <em>I</em> say it. 'Twill else be worse for all!'</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXX.</h2>

<h3>A SLIGHT THING AT THE BEST.</h3>


<div class="drop">
<img src="images/i_222.jpg" alt="S" width="100" height="99" class="cap" />
 <p class="cap_1">So I left Benjamin much frightened, and marvelling,
both at his violent passion, and at the message which
he sent to Madam.</p>
</div>

<p>She was waiting for me at the lodging.</p>

<p>'Madam,' I said, 'I have seen Benjamin. He is
very angry. He bade me go home and ask you concerning his
conditions. We must not anger our best friend, dear Madam.'</p>

<p>She rose from her chair and began to walk about, wringing her
hands as if torn by some violent emotion.</p>

<p>'Oh! my child,' she cried; 'Alice, come to my arms&mdash;if it is
for the last time&mdash;my daughter. More than ever mine, though I
must never call thee daughter.'</p>

<p>She held me in her arms, kissing me tenderly. 'My dear, we
agreed that no sacrifice could be too great for the safety of our boy.
Yes, we agreed to that. Let us kiss each other before we do a
thing after which we can never kiss each other again. No, never
again.'</p>

<p>'Why not again, Madam?'</p>

<p>'Oh,' she pushed me from her, 'it is now eight of the clock, he
will be here at ten! I promised I would tell thee before he came!
And all is in readiness.'</p>

<p>'For what, Madam?'</p>

<p>Why, even then I guessed not her meaning, though I might
have done so; but I never thought that so great a wickedness was
possible!</p>

<p>'No sacrifice should be too great for us!' she cried, clasping her
head with her hands and looking wildly about. 'None too great!
Not even the sacrifice of my own son's love&mdash;no; not that! Why,
let us think of the sacrifices men make for their country, for their
religion. Abraham was ready to offer his son, Isaac; Jephthah
sacrificed his daughter; King Mesha slew his eldest son for a burnt
offering. Thousands of men die every year in battle for their
country. What have we to offer? If we give ourselves, it is
but a slight thing that we offer at the best.'</p>

<p>'Surely, Madam,' I cried, 'you know that we would willingly
die for the sake of Robin?'</p>

<p>'Yes, Child; to die&mdash;to die were nothing. It is to live&mdash;we
must live&mdash;for Robin.'</p>

<p>'I understand not, Madam.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span></p>

<p>'Listen then&mdash;for the time presses, and if he arrives and finds
that I have not broken the thing to thee, he will perhaps ride back to
Exeter in a rage. When I left my son after the trial, being very
wretched and without hope, I found Benjamin waiting for me at
the prison gates. He walked with me to my lodging, and on the
way he talked of what was in my mind. First, he said, that for the
better sort there was little hope, seeing that the King was revengeful
and the Judge most wrathful, and in a mood which allowed of no
mercy. Therefore, it would be best to dismiss all hopes of pardon
or of safety either to these two or to the prisoners of Ilminster.
Now, when he had said this a great many times, we being now
arrived at my lodging, he told me that there was in my case a way
out of the trouble&mdash;and one way only: that if we consented to
follow that way, which, he said, would do no manner of harm to
either of us or to our prisoners, he would undertake and faithfully
engage to secure the safety of all our prisoners. I prayed him to
point out this way, and, after much entreaty, he consented.'</p>

<p>'What is the way?' I asked, having not the least suspicion.
And yet the look in her eyes should have told me what was coming.</p>

<p>'Is it true, Child, that long ago you were betrothed to Benjamin?'</p>

<p>'No, Madam, that is most untrue.'</p>

<p>'He says that when you were quite a little child he informed
you of his intention to marry you, and none but you.'</p>

<p>'Why, that is true, indeed.' And now I began to understand
the way that was proposed; and my heart sank within me. 'That
is true. But to tell a child such a thing is not a betrothal.'</p>

<p>'He says that only three or four years ago he renewed that
assurance.'</p>

<p>'So he did, but I gave him no manner of encouragement.'</p>

<p>'He says that he promised to return and marry you when he
had arrived at some practice, and that he engaged to become Lord
Chancellor and make you a Peeress of the Realm.'</p>

<p>'All that he said, and more. Yet did I never give him the
least encouragement, but quite the contrary, for always have I
feared and disliked Benjamin. Never at any time was it possible
for me to think of him in that way. That he knows, and cannot
pretend otherwise. Madam, doth Benjamin wish evil to Robin
because I am betrothed to him?'</p>

<p>'He also says, in his rude way&mdash;Benjamin was always a rude
and coarse boy&mdash;that he had warned you, long ago, that if anyone
else came in his way he would break the head of that man.'</p>

<p>'Yes: I remember, now, that he threatened some violence.'</p>

<p>'My dear'&mdash;Madam took my hand&mdash;'his time of revenge is
come. He says that he has the life of the man whom you love in
his own hands; and he will, he swears, break his head for him,
and so keep the promise made to you by tying the rope round his
neck. My dear, Benjamin has always been stubborn and obstinate
from his birth. Stubborn and obstinate was he as a boy; stubborn<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
and obstinate is he now. He cares for nobody in the world except
himself; he has no heart; he has no tenderness; he has no
scruples; if he wants a thing, he will trample on all the world to
get it, and break all the laws of God. I know what manner of life
he leads. He is the friend and companion of the dreadful Judge
who goeth about like a raging lion. Every night do they drink
together until they are speechless and cannot stand. Their delight
it is to drink, and smoke tobacco, with unseemly jests and ribald
songs which would disgrace the playhouse or the country fair.
Oh! 'tis the life of a hog that he delights in! Yet, for all that, he
is, like his noble friend, full of ambition. Nothing will do but he
must rise in the world. Therefore, he works hard at his profession&mdash;and'&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>'Madam&mdash;the condition!&mdash;what is the condition? For Heaven's
sake tell me quickly! Is it&mdash;is it!&mdash;oh! no&mdash;no&mdash;no! Anything
but that!'</p>

<p>'My child&mdash;my daughter'&mdash;she laid her hand upon my head.
'It is that condition&mdash;that, and none other. Oh! my dear, it is
laid upon thee to save us!&mdash;it is to be thy work alone&mdash;and by such
a sacrifice as, I think, no woman ever yet had to make! Nay,
perhaps it is better not to make it, after all. Let all die together,
and let us live out our allotted lives in sorrow. I thought of it all
night, and it seemed better so&mdash;better even that thou wert lying in
thy grave. His condition! Oh! he must be a devil thus to barter
for the lives of his grandfather and his cousins&mdash;no human being,
surely, would do such a thing: the condition, my dear, is that thou
must marry him&mdash;now: this very morning&mdash;and this once done, he
will at once take such steps&mdash;I know not what they may be, but I
take it that his friend the Judge will grant him the favour&mdash;such
steps, I say, as will release unto us all our prisoners.'</p>

<p>At first I made no answer.</p>

<p>'If not,' she added after a while, 'they shall all be surely
hanged.'</p>

<p>I remained silent. It is not easy at such a moment to collect
one's thoughts and understand what things mean. I asked her
presently if there was no other way.</p>

<p>'None,' she said: 'there was no other way.'</p>

<p>'What shall I do? What shall I do?' I asked. 'God, it
seems, hath granted my daily prayer; but how? Oh! what shall
I do?'</p>

<p>'Think of what thou hast in thy power.'</p>

<p>'But to marry him&mdash;to marry Benjamin&mdash;oh! to marry him!
How should I live? How should I look the world in the face?'</p>

<p>'My dear, there are many other unhappy wives. There are
other husbands brutal and selfish; there are other men as wicked
as my nephew. Thou wilt swear in church to love, honour, and
obey him. Thy love is already hate; thy honour is contempt; thy
obedience will be the obedience of a slave. Yet death cometh at
length, even to a slave and to the harsh task-master.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span></p>

<p>'Oh! Madam, miserable indeed is the lot of those whose only
friend is death.'</p>

<p>She was silent, leaving me to think of this terrible condition.</p>

<p>'What would Robin say? What would Humphrey say? Nay,
what would his Honour himself say?'</p>

<p>'Why, Child,' she replied, with a kind of laugh, 'it needs not a
wizard to tell what they would say. For one and all, they would
rather go to the gallows than buy their lives at such a price. Thy
brother Barnaby would mount the ladder with a cheerful heart
rather than sell his sister to buy his life. That we know already.
Nay, we know more. For Robin will never forgive his mother who
suffered thee to do such a thing. So shall I lose what I value more
than life&mdash;the love of my only son. Yet would I buy his life at
such a price. My dear, if you lose your lover I lose my son. Yet,
we will save him whether he will or no.' She took my hands and
pressed them in her own. 'My dear, it will be worse for me than
for you. You will have a husband, it is true, whom you will loathe;
yet you will not see him, perhaps, for half the day at least; and,
perhaps, he will leave thee to thyself for the other half. But for
me, I shall have to endure the loss of my son's affections all my
life, because I am very sure and certain that he can never forgive
me. Think, my dear! Shall they all die?&mdash;all!&mdash;think of father
and brother, and of your mother!&mdash;or will you willingly endure a
life of misery with this man for husband in order that they may
live?'</p>

<p>'Oh, Madam,' I said, 'as for the misery&mdash;any other kind of
misery I would willingly endure; but it is marriage&mdash;marriage!
Yet who am I that I should choose my sacrifice? Oh, if good
works were of any avail, then would the way to heaven be opened
wide for me by such an act and such a life! Oh, what will Robin
say of me? What will he think of me? Will he curse me and
loathe me for being able to do this thing? Should I do it? Is it
right? Doth God command it? Yet to save their dear lives&mdash;only
to set them free&mdash;to send that good old man back to his
home&mdash;to suffer my father to die in peace!&mdash;I must do it&mdash;I must
do it! Yet Robin could never forgive me. Oh! he told me that
betrothal was a sacrament. I have sworn to be his. Yet, to save
his life, I cannot hesitate. If it is wrong, I pray that Robin will
forgive me. Tell him&mdash;oh, tell him that it is I who am to die
instead of him. Perhaps the Lord will suffer me to die quickly.
Tell him that I loved him, and only him; that I would rather have
died; that for his life alone I would not have done this thing,
because he would not have suffered it. But it is for all&mdash;it is for
all! Oh! he must forgive me! Some day you will send me a
message of forgiveness from him. But I must go away and live in
London, far from all of you; never to see him or any one of you
again&mdash;not even my own mother. It is too shameful a thing to do.
And you will tell his Honour, who hath always loved me and would
willingly have called me his granddaughter. It was not that I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
loved not Robin&mdash;God knoweth that; but for all&mdash;for him and
Robin and all&mdash;to save his grey hairs from the gallows, and to send
him back to his home. Oh! tell him that'&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>'My dear&mdash;my dear,' she replied, but could say no more.</p>

<p>Then for a while we sat in silence, with beating hearts.</p>

<p>'I am to purchase the lives of five honest men,' I said presently,
'by my own dishonour. I know very well that it is by my dishonour
and my sin that their lives are to be bought. It doth not
save me from dishonour that I am first to stand in the church and
be married according to the Prayer Book. Nay, does it not make
the sin greater and the dishonour more certain that I shall first
swear what I cannot ever perform&mdash;to love and honour that man?'</p>

<p>'Yes, girl&mdash;yes!' said Madam. 'But the sin is mine more than
yours. Oh! let me bear the sin upon myself.'</p>

<p>'You cannot, it is my sin and my dishonour; nay, it is a most
dreadful wicked thing that I am to do. It is all the sins in one: I
do not honour my parents in thus dishonouring myself; I kill myself&mdash;the
woman that my Robin loved; I steal the outward form
which belonged to Robin and give it to another; I live in a kind of
adultery. It is truly a terrible sin in the sight of Heaven. Yet I
will do it!&mdash;I must do it! I love him so that I cannot let him die;
rather let me be overwhelmed with shame and reproach if only he
can live!'</p>

<p>'Said I not, my dear, that we two could never kiss each other
again? When two men have conspired together to commit a crime
they consort no more together, it is said, but go apart and loathe
each other. So it is now with us.'</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>So I promised to do this thing. The temptation was beyond
my strength. Yet had I possessed more faith I should have refused.
And then great, indeed, would have been my reward.
Alas! how was I punished for my want of faith! Well, it was to
save my lover. Love makes us strong for evil as well as strong
for good.</p>

<p>And all the time, to think that we never inquired or proved his
promises! To think that we never thought of doubting or of asking
how he, a young barrister, should be able to save the lives of
four active rebels, and one who had been zealous in the cause!
That two women should have been so simple is now astonishing.</p>

<p>When the clock struck ten I saw Benjamin walking across the
churchyard. It was part of the brutal nature of the man that he
should walk upon the graves, even those newly-made and not
covered up with turf. He swung his great burly form, and looked
up at the window with a grin which made Madam tremble and
shrink back. But for me, I was not moved by the sight of him,
for now I was strong in resolution. Suppose one who hath made
up her mind to go to the stake for her religion, as would doubtless
have happened unto many had King James been allowed to continue
in his course, do you think that such a woman would begin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
to tremble at the sight of her executioner? Not so. She would
arise and go forth to meet him, with pale face, perhaps (because
the agony is sharp), but with a steady eye. Benjamin opened the
door, and stood looking from one to the other.</p>

<p>'Well,' he said to Madam, roughly, 'you have by this time told
her the condition?'</p>

<p>'I have told her&mdash;alas! I have told her, and already I repent
me that I have told her.'</p>

<p>'Doth she consent?'</p>

<p>'She does. It shall be as you desire.'</p>

<p>'Ha!' Benjamin drew a long breath. 'Said I not, Sweetheart'&mdash;he
turned to me&mdash;'that I would break the head of any who came
between us? What? Have I not broken the head of my cousin
when I take away his girl? Very well, then. And that to good
purpose. Very well, then. It remains to carry out the condition.'</p>

<p>'The condition,' I said, 'I understand to be this. If I become
your wife, Benjamin, you knowing full well that I love another
man and am already promised to him'&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>'Ta&mdash;ta&mdash;ta!' he said. 'That you are promised to another
man matters not one straw. That you love another man I care
nothing. What! I promise, Sweetheart, that I will soon make
thee forget that other man. And as for loving any other man after
marrying me, that, d'ye see, my pretty, will be impossible. Oh!
thou shalt be the fondest wife in the Three Kingdoms.'</p>

<p>'Nay: if such a thing cannot move your heart, I say no more.
If I marry you, then all our prisoners will be enlarged?'</p>

<p>'I swear'&mdash;he used a great round oath, very horrid from the
lips of a Christian man&mdash;'I swear that, if you marry me, the three&mdash;Robin,
Humphrey, and Barnaby&mdash;shall all save their lives. And
as for Sir Christopher and thy father, they also shall be enlarged.
Can I say aught in addition?'</p>

<p>I suspected no deceit. I understood, and so did Madam, that
this promise meant the full and free forgiveness of all. Yet there
was something of mockery in his eyes, which should have made us
suspicious. But I, for one, was young and ignorant, and Madam
was country-bred and truthful.</p>

<p>'Benjamin,' I cried, falling on my knees before him, 'think
what it is you ask! Think what a wicked thing you would have
me do!&mdash;to break my vows, who am promised to your cousin!
And would you leave your grandfather to perish all for a whim
about a silly girl? Benjamin, you are playing with us. You cannot&mdash;you
could not sell the lives&mdash;the very lives of your grandfather
and your cousins for such a price as this! The play has
gone far enough, Benjamin. Tell us that it is over, and that you
never meant to be taken seriously, and we will forgive you the
anguish you have caused us.'</p>

<p>'Get up,' he said, 'get up, I say, and stop this folly.' He then
began to curse and to swear. 'Playing, is it? You shall quickly
discover that it is no play, but serious enough to please you all,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
Puritans though you be. Playing! Get up, I say, and have
done.'</p>

<p>'Then,' I said, 'there is not in the whole world a more inhuman
monster than yourself.'</p>

<p>'Oh! my dear&mdash;my dear, do not anger him!' cried Madam.</p>

<p>'All is fair in love, my pretty,' said Benjamin with a grin.
'Before marriage call me what you please&mdash;inhuman monster&mdash;anything
that you please. After marriage my wife will have to sing
a different tune.'</p>

<p>'Oh! Benjamin, treat her kindly,' Madam cried.</p>

<p>'I mean not otherwise. Kindness is my nature, I am too
kind for my own interests. Obedience I expect, and good temper
and a civil tongue, with such respect as is due to one who intends
to be Lord Chancellor. Come, Child, no more hard words. Thou
shalt be the happiest woman, I say, in the world. What? Monmouth's
rebellion was only contrived to make thy happiness. Instead
of a dull country house thou shalt have a house in London; instead
of the meadows, thou shalt have the parks; instead of skylarks,
the singers at the playhouse; in due course thou shalt be My
Lady'&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>'Oh! stop&mdash;stop; I must marry you since you make me, but
the partner in your ambitions will I never be.'</p>

<p>'My dear,' Madam whispered, 'speak him fair. Be humble to
him. Remember he holds in his hands the lives of all.'</p>

<p>'Yes,' Benjamin overheard her. 'The lives of all. The man
who dares to take my girl from me&mdash;mine&mdash;deserves to die. Yet
so clement, so forgiving, so generous am I, that I am ready to
pardon him. He shall actually save his life. If, therefore, it is
true that (before marriage) you love that man and are promised to
him, come to church with me, out of your great love to him, in
order to save his life; but if you love him not, then you can love
me, and, therefore, can come to please yourself, willy nilly. What!
am I to be thwarted in such a trifle? Willy nilly, I say, I will
marry thee. Come&mdash;we waste the time.'</p>

<p>He seized my wrist as if he would have dragged me towards the
door.</p>

<p>'Benjamin,' cried Madam, 'be merciful! she is but a girl, and
she loves my poor boy&mdash;be merciful! Oh! it is not yet too late.'
She snatched me from his grasp and stood between us, her arms
outstretched. 'It is not too late; they may die and we will go in
sorrow, but not in shame. They may die. Go! murderer of thy
kith and kin! Go, send thy grandfather to die upon the scaffold;
but, at least, leave us in peace.'</p>

<p>'No, Madam,' I said. 'With your permission, if there be no
other way, I will save their lives.'</p>

<p>'Well, then,' Benjamin said sulkily, 'there must be an end of
this talk and no further delay; else, by the Lord! I know not
what may happen. Will Tom Boilman delay to prepare his cauldron
of hot pitch? If we wait much longer, Robin's arms and legs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
will be seething in that broth! Doth the Judge delay with his
warrant? Already he signs it&mdash;already they are putting up the
gibbet on which he will hang! Come, I say.'</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Benjamin was sure of his prey, I suppose, because we found the
clergyman waiting for us in the church, ready with surplice and
book. The clerk was standing beside him, also with his book, open
at the Service for Marriage. While they read the Service Madam
threw herself prostrate on the Communion steps, her head in her
hands, as one who suffers the last extremities of remorse and despair
for sin too grievous to be ever forgiven. Let us hope that
sometimes we may judge ourselves more harshly than Heaven
itself doth judge us.</p>

<p>The clerk gave me away, and was the only witness of the
marriage besides that poor distracted mother.</p>

<p>'Twas a strange wedding. There had been no banns put up;
the bride was pale and trembling; the bridegroom was gloomy;
the only other person present wept upon her knees while the parson
read through his ordered prayer and psalm and exhortation; there
was no sign of rejoicing.</p>

<p>'So,' said Benjamin, when all was over, 'now thou art my
wife. They shall not be hanged therefor. Come, wife, we will
this day ride to Exeter, where thou shalt thyself bear the joyful
news of thy marriage and their safety to my cousins. They will
own that I am a loving and a careful cousin.'</p>

<p>He led me, thus talking, out of church. Now, as we left the
churchyard, there passed through the gates&mdash;oh, baleful omen!&mdash;four
men carrying between them a bier. Upon it was the body of
another poor prisoner, dead of jail fever. I think that even the
hard heart of Benjamin&mdash;now my husband!&mdash;oh! merciful
Heavens! he was my husband!&mdash;quailed, and was touched with
fear at meeting this most sure and certain sign of coming woe, for
he muttered something in his teeth, and cursed the bearers aloud
for not choosing another time.</p>

<p>My husband, then&mdash;I must needs call him my husband&mdash;told
me, brutally, that I must ride with him to Exeter, where I should
myself bear the joyful news of their safety to his cousins. I did
not take that journey, nor did I bear the news, nor did I ever after
that moment set eyes upon him again, nor did I ever speak to him
again. His wife I remained, I suppose, because I was joined to
him in church. But I never saw him after that morning. And
the reason why you shall now hear.</p>

<p>At the door of our lodging, which was, you know, hard by the
church, stood Mr. Boscorel himself.</p>

<p>'What means this?' he asked, with looks troubled and confused.
'What doth it mean, Benjamin? What hath happened,
in the name of God?'</p>

<p>'Sir,' said Benjamin, 'you know my character. You will
acknowledge that I am not one of those who are easily turned from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
their purpose. Truly, the occasion is not favourable for a wedding,
but yet I present to you my newly-married wife.'</p>

<p>'<em>Thy</em> wife! Child, <em>he</em> thy husband? Why, thou art betrothed
to Robin! Hath the world gone crazy? Do I hear aright? Is
this&mdash;this&mdash;this&mdash;a time to be marrying? Hast thou not heard?
Hast thou not heard, I say?'</p>

<p>'Brother-in-law,' said Madam, 'it is to save the lives of all that
this is done.'</p>

<p>'"To save the lives of all?"' Mr. Boscorel repeated. 'Why&mdash;why&mdash;hath
not Benjamin, then, told what hath happened, and
what hath been done?'</p>

<p>'No, Sir, I have not,' said his son. 'I had other fish to fry.'</p>

<p>'Not told them? Is it possible?'</p>

<p>'Benjamin hath promised to save all their lives if this child
would marry him. To save their lives hath Alice consented, and I
with her. He will save them through his great friendship with
Judge Jeffreys.'</p>

<p>'Benjamin to save their lives? Sirrah'&mdash;he turned to his son
with great wrath in his face&mdash;'what villainy is this? Thou hast
promised to save their lives? What villainy, I say, is this?
Sister-in-law, did he not tell you what hath been done?'</p>

<p>'He has told us nothing. Oh! is there new misery?'</p>

<p>'Child'&mdash;Mr. Boscorel spoke with the tears running down his
cheeks&mdash;'thou art betrayed&mdash;alas! most cruelly and foully betrayed.
My son&mdash;would to God that I had died before I should
say so&mdash;is a villain! For, first, the lives of these young men are
already saved, and he hath known it for a week and more. Learn,
then, that with the help of certain friends I have used such interests
at Court that for these three I have received the promise of safety.
Yet they will not be pardoned. They are given, among other
prisoners, to the courtiers and the ladies-in-waiting. One Mr.
Jerome Nipho hath received and entered on his list the names of
Robin and Humphrey Challis and Barnaby Eykin; they will be
sold by him, and transported to Jamaica or elsewhere for a term of
years.'</p>

<p>'They were already saved!' cried Madam. 'He knew, then,
when they were tried and sentenced, that their lives were already
spared. Oh, child! poor child! Oh, Alice! Oh, my daughter!
what misery have we brought upon thee!'</p>

<p>Benjamin said nothing. On his face lay a scowl of obstinacy.
As for me, I was clinging to Madam's arm. This man was my husband&mdash;and
Robin was already saved&mdash;and by lies and villainy he
had cheated us!</p>

<p>'They were already saved,' Mr. Boscorel continued. 'Benjamin
knew it&mdash;I sent him a letter that he might tell his cousins.
My son&mdash;alas!&mdash;I say again, my only son&mdash;my only son&mdash;my son
is a villain!'</p>

<p>'No one shall take my girl,' said Benjamin sullenly. 'What?
All is fair in love.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span></p>

<p>'He has not told you, either, what hath happened in the prison?
Thou hadst speech, I hear, with Barnaby, early this morning,
Child. The other prisoners'&mdash;he lowered his voice and folded his
hands, as in prayer&mdash;'they have since been enlarged.'</p>

<p>'How?' Madam asked. 'Is Sir Christopher free?'</p>

<p>'He hath received his freedom&mdash;from One who never fails to
set poor prisoners free. My father-in-law fell dead in the courtyard
at nine o'clock this morning&mdash;weep not for him. But, Child,
there is much more; about that same time thy father breathed his
last. He, too, is dead; he, too, hath his freedom, Benjamin knew
of this as well, Alice, my child'&mdash;the kindly tears of compassion
rolled down his face. 'I have loved thee always, my dear; and it
is my son who hath wrought this wickedness&mdash;my own son&mdash;my
only son'&mdash;&mdash;he shook his cane in Benjamin's face. 'Oh, villain!'
he cried; 'oh, villain!'</p>

<p>Benjamin made no reply; but his face was black and his eyes
obstinate.</p>

<p>'There is yet more&mdash;oh! there is more. Alas! my child, there
is more. Thou hast lost thy mother as well. For at the sight of
her husband's death, his poor, patient wife could no longer bear the
trouble, but she, too, fell dead&mdash;of a broken heart; yea, she fell
dead upon his dead body&mdash;the Lord showed her this great and
crowning mercy&mdash;so that they all died together. This, too, Benjamin
knew. Oh! villain! villain!'</p>

<p>Benjamin heard unmoved, except that his scowl grew blacker.</p>

<p>'Go,' his father continued, 'I load thee not, my son, with a
father's curse. Thy wickedness is so great that thy punishment
will be exemplary. The judgments of God descend upon the most
hardened. Get thee gone out of my sight. Let me never more
behold thee until thou hast felt the intolerable pangs of remorse.
Get thee hence I say! begone!'</p>

<p>'I go not,' said Benjamin, 'without my loving wife. I budge
not, I say, without my tender and loving wife. Come, my dear.'</p>

<p>He advanced with outstretched hands, but I broke away and
fled shrieking. As I ran, Mr. Boscorel stood before his son and
barred the way, raising his right hand.</p>

<p>'Back, boy! Back!' he said, solemnly. 'Back, I say! Before
thou reachest thy most unhappy wife, first shalt thou pass over thy
father's body!'</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXI.</h2>

<h3>THE VISION OF CONSOLATION.</h3>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 237px;">
<img src="images/i_232.jpg" width="237" height="350" alt="I ran" />
</div>

<p>I ran so fast, being then
young and strong, that
Benjamin, I am sure, could
not have overtaken me
had he tried, because he
was already gross of body
and short of breath in
consequence of his tippling.
I have since heard
that he did not follow me,
nor did he dare to push
aside his father. But he
laughed and said, 'Let
her run; let her run. I warrant
I shall find her and bring her back;'
thinking, I suppose, that I had run
from him as a girl in play runs from
her companions. I ran also so long,
fear lending me strength, that the
sun was getting even into the afternoon before
I ventured to stop. I looked round from time
to time, but saw no one following me. I do
not remember by what road, track, or path I went:
pasture fields and plantations I remember; twice
I crossed a stream on stepping-stones; once I saw
before me a village with a church tower; but this
I avoided for fear of the people. When I ventured
to stop, I was in a truly wild and desolate country&mdash;our
county of Somerset hath in it many such wild places, given over
to forests, fern, and heather. Presently I remembered the place,
though one forest is much like another, and I knew that I had
been in this part before, on that day when we rode from Lyme to
Taunton, and again on the day when we walked prisoners with the
soldiers to Ilminster. I was on the Black Down Hills again.</p>

<p>When, therefore, I understood where I was, I began to recover
a little from the first horror which had driven me to fly like one
possessed of an evil spirit; and, seeing that no one was in pursuit, I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
began to collect my senses and to ask myself whither I was going,
and what I should do. I was then near that ancient inclosure
called Castle Ratch, from whose walls one looks down upon the
broad vale of Taunton Dean. In the distance, I thought I could
discern the great tower of St. Mary's Church: but perhaps that
was only my imagination. I sat down, therefore, upon the turf
under these ancient walls, and set myself to consider my condition,
which was indeed forlorn.</p>

<p>First, I had no friends or protectors left in the whole world,
because after what I had done I could never look upon Robin or
even Humphrey again; nor could I importune Madam, because
she would not anger her son (I represented him in my mind as
most unforgiving); nor could I seek the help of Mr. Boscorel,
because that might help his son to find me out, and everybody
knows that a husband may command the obedience of his wife.
And Sir Christopher was dead, and my father was dead, and my
mother was dead, and I could not even weep beside their coffins or
follow their bodies to the grave. A woman without friends in this
world is like unto a traveller in a sandy desert without a bottle of
water.</p>

<p>Yet was I so far better than some of these poor friendless
creatures, because I had, concealed upon me, a bag containing all
the money which Barnaby had given me&mdash;two hundred and fifty
gold pieces&mdash;save a little which we had expended at Taunton and
Ilminster. This is a great sum, and by its help I could, I thought
with satisfaction, live for a long time, perhaps all my life, if I
could find some safe retreat among godly people.</p>

<p>No friends? Why, there was Susan Blake of Taunton&mdash;she
who walked with the Maids when they gave Monmouth the Bible,
the sword, and the flags. I resolved that I would go to her and tell
her all that had happened. Out of her kindness she would take
me in and help me to find some safe hiding-place and perhaps
some honest way of living, so as to save his money against Barnaby's
return from the Plantations.</p>

<p>Then I thought I would find out the valley where we had lived
for a fortnight, and rest for one night in the hut, and in the early
morning before daybreak walk down the comb and so into Taunton
while as yet the town was still sleeping. And this I did. It was
very easy to find the head of the comb and the source of the
stream, where we had made our encampment. Close by, beneath
the trees, was Barnaby's hut: no one had been there to disturb or
destroy it; but the leaves upon the boughs which formed its sides
were now dead. Within it the fern and the heath which had
formed my bed were still dry. Outside, the pot hung over the
black embers of our last fire; and, to my great joy, in the basket
which had contained our provisions I found a large crust of bread.
It was, to be sure, dry and hard; but I dipped it in the running
water of the stream and made my supper with it. For dessert I
had blackberries, which were by this time ripe, and are nowhere<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
bigger or sweeter than on Black Down. There were also filberts
and nuts, now ripe, of which I gathered a quantity, so that I had
breakfast provided for me, as well as supper.</p>

<p>When I had done this, I was so tired and my head was so giddy
with the terror of the day, that I lay down upon the fern in the
hut and there fell fast asleep and so continued until far into the
night.</p>

<p>Now, in my sleep a strange thing happened unto me. For my
own part, I account it nothing less than a Vision granted unto me
by mercy and special grace of Heaven. Those who read of it may
call it what they please. It was in this wise. There appeared
before my sleeping eyes (but they seemed wide open), as it were, a
broad and open champaign; presently there came running across
the plain in great terror, shrieking and holding her hands aloft, a
girl, whose face at first I could not see. She ran in this haste and
terrible anguish of fear because there followed after her a troop of
dogs, barking and yelping. Behind the dogs rode on horseback one
whose face I saw not any more than that of the girl. He cursed
and swore (I knew the voice, but could not tell, being in a dream,
to whom it belonged), and cracked a horrid whip and encouraged
the dogs, lashing the laggards. In his eyes (though his face was
in some kind of shadow) there was such a look as I remembered in
Benjamin's when he put the ring upon my finger&mdash;a look of resolute
and hungry wickedness, which made me tremble and shake.</p>

<p>Now, as I looked, the dogs still gained upon her who ran, and
yelped as if in a few moments they would spring upon her and tear
her flesh from her bones. Then suddenly, between her who ran
and those who pursued, there arose an awful form. He was clad in
white, and in his hand he bore a sword, and he turned upon that
hunter a face filled with wrath. Lightnings shot from his eyes and
a cloud of thunder lay upon his brow. At the sight of that face
the dogs stopped in their running, cowered, and fell dead. And at
the dreadful aspect of that face the hunter's horse fell headlong,
and his rider, falling also with a shriek of terror, broke his neck,
and so lay prostrate and dead. Then this dreadful minister of
God's wrath turned from him to the flying figure, and lo! his face
was now transformed; his eyes became soft and full of love; he
smiled graciously; a crown of glory was upon his head; white
robes flowed downward to his feet; his fiery sword was a palm
branch: he was the Angel of Consolation. 'Have no more fear,'
he said, 'though the waves of the sea rise up against thee and the
winds threaten to drown thee in the deep. Among the ungodly
and the violent thou shalt be safe; in all times of peril the Lord
will uphold thee; earthly joy shall be thine. Be steadfast unto
the end.'</p>

<p>And then I looked again, those blessed words ringing in my
ears; and behold! I saw then, which I had not seen before, that
the flying figure was none other than myself; that he who cruelly
hunted after with the dogs and the whip was none other than my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
husband; and that the Angel of Wrath, who became the Angel of
Consolation, was none other than my father himself! But he was
glorified! Oh! the face was his face&mdash;that, anyone could see; but
it was changed into something&mdash;I know not what&mdash;so far brighter
and sweeter than the earthly face, that I marvelled! Then the
Vision disappeared, and I awoke.</p>

<p>So bright and clear had it been that I seemed to see it still,
though I was sitting up with my eyes open, and it was night.
Then it slowly vanished. Henceforth, however, I was assured of
two things: first, that no harm would happen unto me, but that I
should be protected from the malice of my enemies, whatever they
might design (indeed, I had but one enemy&mdash;to wit, the man who
had that morning sworn to love and cherish me); and next, that I
had seen with mortal eyes what, indeed, hath been vouchsafed to
few, the actual spiritual body&mdash;the glorified body, like to the
earthly, but changed&mdash;with which the souls of the Elect are
clothed.</p>

<p>So I arose now without the least fear. It was night; but in
the East there showed the first grey of the dawn, and the birds
were already beginning to twitter as if they were dreaming of the
day. The wind was fresh, and I was lightly clad, but the splendour
of the Vision made me forget the cold. Oh! I had received a
voice from heaven! How could I henceforth fear anything? Nay,
there was no room even for grief, though those terrible things had
fallen upon me, and I was now alone and friendless, and the world
is full of ungodly men.</p>

<p>It must have been about half-past four in the morning. It grew
light quickly, so that not only the trees became visible, but the
black depths between them changed into glades and underwood,
and I could see my way down the comb beside the stream. Then,
without waiting for the sun to rise (which he presently did in great
warmth and splendour), I started, hoping to get into Taunton before
the people were up and the streets became crowded. But I did not
know the distance, which must have been seven miles at least, because
it was nearly eight o'clock when I reached the town, having
followed the course of the stream through three villages, which I
have since learned must have been those of Pitminster, Trull, and
Wilton.</p>

<p>It was market day, and the streets were full of country people&mdash;some
of them farmers with bags of corn in their hands, going to
the corn-market, and some with carts full of fresh fruit and other
things. Their faces were heavy and sad, and they talked in whispers
as if they were afraid. They had, indeed, good cause for fear;
for the prison held over five hundred unfortunate men waiting for
their trial, and the terrible Judge was already on his way with his
carts filled with more prisoners rumbling after him. Already
Colonel Kirke had caused I know not how many to be hanged, and
the reports of what had been done at Dorchester and Exeter
sufficiently prepared the minds of the wretched prisoners at Taunton<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
for what was about to be done there. Among them was the
unfortunate Captain Hucker, the Serge-Maker, who had looked for
a Peerage, and was now to receive a halter. There was also among
them that poor man, Mr. Simon Hamlyn, who was hanged only for
riding into Taunton in order to dissuade his son from joining Monmouth.
This the Mayor of Taunton pointed out to the bloodthirsty
Judge; but in vain. The whole five hundred prisoners
were, in the end, sentenced to death; and one hundred and forty-five
actually suffered, to the great indignation of those who looked
on, even of the King's party. Nay, at one of the executions, when
nineteen were hanged at the same time, and a great fire was made
so that the sufferers might actually see before their death the fire
that was to burn their bowels, the very soldiers wept, saying that it
was so sad a thing they scarce knew how to bear it. Three years
later, the hard heart of the King met with its proper punishment.</p>

<p>The soldiers were among the crowd, some leaning against bulkheads,
some drinking at the ale-houses, some haggling for the fruit;
some were also exercising upon Castle Green. They looked good-natured,
and showed in their faces none of the cruelty and rage
which belonged to their officers. But what a doleful change from
the time when Monmouth's soldiers filled the town, and all hearts
were full of joy, and every face shone with happiness! What a
change, indeed!</p>

<p>As I passed among the crowd, one caught me by the arm. It
was a little old woman, her face all wrinkled and puckered. She
was sitting on a stool beside a great basketful of apples and plums,
and a short pipe of tobacco within her lips.</p>

<p>'Mistress,' she whispered, taking the pipe from her mouth.
'Thou wert with the Maids the day of the Flags: I remember thy
pretty face. What dost thou here abroad among the people? The
air of Taunton town is unwholesome! There may be others who
will remember thee as well as I. Take an old woman's advice, and
get thee gone. How fares it with thy father, the worthy Dr. Eykin?'</p>

<p>'Alas!' I said, 'he died in Ilminster Jail.'</p>

<p>''Tis pity. But he was old and pious: he hath gone to glory.
Whither will those poor lads in the Clink go when they are hanged?
Get thee gone, get thee gone! The air is already foul with dead
men's bodies: they tell strange stories of what hath been done by
women for the safety of their brothers. Get thee gone, pretty
maid, lest something worse than prison happen to thee. And Judge
Jeffreys is coming hither like the Devil, having much wrath.'</p>

<p>I could not tell her that nothing would happen to me, because
I was protected by a Heavenly Guard.</p>

<p>'I was in the town forty years agone,' the old woman went on,
'when Blake defended it, and we were well-nigh starved. But
never have I seen such things as have been done here since the
Duke was routed. Get thee gone!&mdash;haste away, as from the mouth
of Hell!&mdash;get thee gone, poor child!'</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 450px;">
<img src="images/i_237.jpg" width="450" height="600" alt="crowd" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">'<i>As I passed through the crowd, one caught me by the arm.</i>'</p></div>
</div>

<p>So I left her, and went on my way, hanging my head, in hopes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
that no one else would recognise me. Fortunately, no one did,
though I saw many faces which I had seen in the town before.
They were then tossing their caps and shouting for Monmouth, but
were now gloomily whispering, as if every man feared that his own
turn would come next. Over the great gateway of the Castle was
stuck up a high row of heads, arms, and legs of rebels blackened
with pitch&mdash;a horrid sight. Unto this end had come those brave
fellows who went forth to dethrone the King. No one noticed or
accosted me, and I arrived safely at Susan's house. The door
seemed shut, but when I pushed I found that it was open&mdash;the lock
having been broken from its fastening. Barnaby did that, I remembered.
I went in shutting it, after me. No doubt Susan was
with her children in the schoolroom. Strange that she should not
repair her lock, and that at a time when the town was full of
soldiers, who always carry with them their riotous and lawless followers.
'Twas unlike her orderly housekeeping.</p>

<p>There was no one in the back parlour, where Susan commonly
took her meals and conducted the morning and evening prayers.
The dishes were on the table, as if of last night's supper or yesterday's
dinner. This was, also, unlike a tidy housewife. I opened
the door of the front parlour. Though it was already past the
hour for school, there were no children in the room; the lesson-books
and copying-books and slates lay about the floor. What did
this untidy litter mean? Then I went up-stairs and into the bedrooms,
of which there were three&mdash;namely, two on the floor above,
and one a garret. No one was in them, and the beds had not been
made. There remained only the kitchen. No one was there.
The house was quite empty; I observed also that the garden,
which was wont to be kept with the greatest neatness, now
looked neglected; the ripe plums were dropping from the
branches trained upon the wall; the apples lay upon the grass;
the flower-beds were cumbered with weeds; grass grew in the
walks; the lawn, which had been so neat and trim, was covered
with long grass.</p>

<p>What had happened? Where was Susan? Then I seemed to
hear her voice above thanking God for the victory, as she had done
when Barnaby burst in upon us; and methought I heard her
singing a hymn with the children, as she had done while we all sat
embroidering the Flags. Oh! the pretty Flags! And oh! the
pretty sight of the innocents in white and blue carrying those
Flags! The house was filled with the sounds of bygone happiness.
Had I stayed another moment I am certain that I should have seen
the ghosts of those who filled the rooms in the happy days when
the army was in the town. But I did not stay. Not knowing
what to do or whither to fly, I ran quickly out of the house, thinking
only to get away from the mournful silence of the empty and
deserted rooms. Then, as I stepped into the street, I met, face to
face, none other than Mr. George Penne, the kind-hearted gentleman
who had compassionated the prisoners at Ilminster.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXII.</h2>

<h3>THE MAN OF SAMARIA.</h3>


<div class="drop">
<img src="images/i_240.jpg" alt="T" width="100" height="100" class="cap" />
 <p class="cap_1">Tis no other than the Fair Maid of Ilminster!' said
Mr. Penne, with surprise. 'Madam, with submission,
is it safe&mdash;is it prudent&mdash;for one who walked
with the Maids of Taunton on a certain memorable
day, to venture openly into the streets of this city
at such a time? Judge Jeffreys doth approach to hold his Court.
Thy friends are in prison or in hiding. The Maids are scattered all.'</p>
</div>

<p>'I sought shelter,' I said, 'at the house of Susan Blake, the
schoolmistress.'</p>

<p>'How? You have not heard, then? Miss Susan Blake is
dead.'</p>

<p>'She is dead?'</p>

<p>'She died in Dorchester Jail, whither she was sent, being specially
exempted from any pardon. 'Twas fever carried her off. She is
dead! Alas! the waste of good lives! She might have bought
her freedom after a while, and then&mdash;but&mdash;well, 'tis useless to
lament these mishaps.'</p>

<p>'Alas! alas!' I cried, wringing my hands. 'Then am I in
evil plight indeed! All, all are dead!&mdash;all my friends are dead!'</p>

<p>'Madam,' he replied very kindly, 'not all your friends, if I
may say so. I have, I assure you, a most compassionate heart. I
bleed for the sufferings of others; I cannot rest until I have
brought relief. This is my way. Oh! I take not credit to myself
therefor. It is that I am so constituted; I am not proud or uplifted
on this account. Only tell me your case, entrust your safety
to me. You may do so safely if you reflect for one moment,
because&mdash;see&mdash;one word from me and you would be taken to
prison by yon worthy clergyman, who is none other than the
Rev. Mr. Walter Harte, the Vicar of Taunton. No one is more
active against the rebels, and he would rejoice in committing thee
on the charge of having been among the Maids. A word from
me would, I say, cause you to be hauled to jail; but, observe, I
do not speak that word&mdash;God forbid that I should speak that
word!'</p>

<p>'Oh, Sir!' I said, 'this goodness overwhelms me.'</p>

<p>'Then, Madam, for greater privacy, let us go back into the
house and converse there.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span></p>

<p>So we went back into the empty house and sat in the back
parlour.</p>

<p>'As for the nature of your trouble, Madam,' he began, 'I hope
you have no dear brothers or cousins among those poor fellows in
Taunton Jail.'</p>

<p>'No, Sir; my only brother is at Ilminster, and my cousins are
far away in New England.'</p>

<p>'That is well. One who, like myself, is of a compassionate
disposition, cannot but bewail the grievous waste in jail fever,
smallpox, scarlet fever, or putrid throat (to say nothing of the
hangings), which now daily happens in the prison. What doth it
avail to hang and quarter a man, when he might be usefully set
to work upon his Majesty's Plantations? It is a most sinful and
foolish waste, I say'&mdash;he spoke with great sincerity and warmth&mdash;'and
a robbing of the pockets of honest merchants.'</p>

<p>'Indeed, Sir,' I said, 'your words prove the goodness of your
heart.'</p>

<p>'Let my deeds rather than my words prove that. How fare the
prisoners with whom you are most concerned?'</p>

<p>'Alas! Sir Christopher is dead! and my father hath also died
of his wound.'</p>

<p>'So?&mdash;indeed? More waste! They are dead. More waste!
But one was old: had Sir Christopher been sent to the Plantations,
his value would have been but small, though, indeed, a ransom&mdash;but
he is dead; and your father, being wounded&mdash;but they are
dead, and so no more need be said. There are, however, others,
if I remember aright?'</p>

<p>'There is my brother in Ilminster Prison, and&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Yes; the two young gentlemen&mdash;Challis is their name&mdash;in
Exeter. I have seen them and conversed with them. Strong
young men, especially one of them. 'Tis sad, indeed, to think
that they may be cut off in the very bloom of their age when they
would command so high a price in Jamaica or Barbadoes. I ventured
to beg before their trial that they would immediately begin
to use whatever interest they might be able to command in order
to get their sentence (which was certain) commuted. Many will
be suffered to go abroad&mdash;why not these young gentlemen? But
they have no interest, they assured me; and therefore I fear that
they will die. 'Tis most sad. They cannot hang all&mdash;that is quite
true; but then these young gentlemen were officers in the army,
and therefore an example will be made of them if they have no
interest at Court.'</p>

<p>'Well, Sir,' I told him, pleased to find him of such a kindly
and thoughtful disposition, 'you will be glad to hear that they
are already pardoned, and have been presented by the King to a
gentleman at Court.'</p>

<p>'Aha! Sayest thou so?' His eyes glittered, and he rubbed
his hands. 'This is, indeed, joyful news. One of them, Mr.
Robin Challis, is a goodly lad, like to whom there are few sent out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
to the Plantations. He will certainly fetch a good price. The
other, Mr. Humphrey, who is somewhat crooked, will go for less.
Who hath obtained the gift of these young gentlemen?'</p>

<p>'It is a person named Mr. Nipho.'</p>

<p>'Mr. Jerome Nipho. I know him well. He is a good Catholic&mdash;I
mean a Papist&mdash;and is much about the Court. He is lucky in
having had many prisoners given to him. And now, Madam, I
hope you will command my services.'</p>

<p>'In what way, Sir?'</p>

<p>'In this way. I am, as I have told you'&mdash;here he wagged his
head and winked both his eyes, and laughed pleasantly&mdash;'one of
those foolish busybodies who love to be still doing good to their
fellow-creatures. To do good is my whole delight. Unfortunately,
the opportunities are rare of conferring exemplary benefit upon
my fellow-men. But here the way seems clear.'</p>

<p>He rubbed his hands and laughed again, repeating that the way
was clear before him, so that I believed myself fortunate in falling
in with so virtuous a person.</p>

<p>'Oh, Sir,' I cried, 'would that the whole world would so live
and so act!'</p>

<p>'Truly, if it did, we should have the prisons cleared. There
should be no more throwing away of good lives in hanging; no
more waste of stout fellows and lusty wenches by fever and small-pox.
All should go to the Plantations&mdash;all. Now, Madam, to our
business, which is the advantage of these young gentlemen. Know,
therefore, that Mr. Jerome Nipho, with all those who have received
presents of prisoners, straightway sells them to persons who engage
to transport them across the seas to his Majesty's Plantations
in Jamaica, Virginia, or elsewhere. There they are bound to work
for a certain term of years. Call it not work, however,' he added
quickly; 'say rather that they are invited every day to exercise
themselves in the cotton and the sugar fields. The climate is delightful;
the sky is seldom clouded; there are never any frosts or
snows; it is always summer; the fruits are delicious; they have a
kind of spirit distilled from the sugar canes which is said to be
finer and more wholesome than the best Nantz; the food is palatable
and plentiful, though plain. The masters or employers (call
them rather friends) are gentlemen of the highest humanity, and
the society is composed of sober merchants, wealthy planters, and
gentlemen, like your brother, who have had the misfortune to
differ in opinions from the Government.'</p>

<p>'Why, Sir,' I said, 'I have always understood that the transported
prisoners are treated with the greatest inhumanity: forced
to work in heat such as we never experience, driven with the lash,
and half-starved, so that none ever come back.'</p>

<p>He shook his head gently. 'See now,' he said, 'how prejudices
arise. Who could have thought that the Plantations should be thus
regarded? 'Tis true that there are estates cultivated by convicts of
another kind&mdash;I mean robbers, highwaymen, petty thieves, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
the like. Bristol doth every year send away a shipload at least of
such. Nay, 'tis reported that rather than hang murderers and the
like the Bristol merchants buy them of the magistrates; but this
is out of the kindness of their hearts. Madam,' he thrust his
hand into his bosom and looked me in the face, 'I myself am sometimes
engaged in that trade. I myself buy these unhappy prisoners
and send them to estates where I know they will be treated with
the greatest kindness. Do I look like a dishonest man, Madam?
As for my name it is George Penne, and I am known to every man
of credit in Bristol. Do I talk like one who would make money
out of his neighbours' sufferings? Nay, if that is so, let us part
at once and say no more. Madam, your humble servant&mdash;no harm
is done: your humble servant, madam.' He put his hat under his
arm, and made as if he would go; but I begged him to remain, and
to advise me further in the matter.</p>

<p>Then I asked him if transported persons ever came home again.</p>

<p>'Surely,' he replied, 'some of them come home laden with
gold. Some, possessed of places both of honour and of profit,
who return to visit their friends, and then go back to the new
country. It is a very Eldorado, or land of gold, to those who are
willing to work; and for those who have money and choose to buy
exemption from work, it is only an agreeable residence in cheerful
society for a certain term of years. Have you, by chance, Madam,
any friends who can influence Mr. Jerome Nipho?'</p>

<p>'No, Sir, I have none.'</p>

<p>'Then will I myself communicate with that gentleman. Understand,
Madam, that I shall have to pay him so much a head for every
prisoner; that I shall be engaged to place every man on board
ship; that the prisoners will then be taken across the seas and
again sold. But in the case of those who have money, a ransom
can be procured, by means of which they will not have to work.'</p>

<p>So far he had spoken in the belief that I was at Taunton on my
brother's business, or that of my friends. I told him, therefore,
that certain events had occurred which would prevent me from
seeing the prisoners at Exeter. And because I could not forbear
from weeping while I spoke, he very earnestly begged me to inform
him fully in every particular as to my history, adding that his
benevolence was not confined to the unhappy case of prisoners, but
that it was ready to be extended in any other direction that happy
chance might offer.</p>

<p>Therefore, being, as you have seen, so friendless and so ignorant,
and so fearful of falling into my husband's hands, and at the same
time so grateful to this good man for his kindly offers (indeed, I
took him for an instrument provided by Heaven for the safety
promised in my vision of the night), that I told him everything
exactly, concealing nothing. Nay, I even told him of the bag of
gold which I had tied round my waist&mdash;a thing which I had hitherto
concealed, because the money was not mine, but Barnaby's.
But I told it to Mr. Penne.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span></p>

<p>While I related my history he interrupted me by frequent
ejaculations, showing his abhorrence of the wickedness with which
Benjamin compassed his design, and when I finished, he held up
his hands in amazement.</p>

<p>'Good God!' he cried; 'that such a wretch should live! That
he should be allowed still to cumber the earth! What punishment
were fitting for this devil in the shape of a man? Madam, your
case is, indeed, one that would move the heart of Nero himself.
What is to be done?'</p>

<p>'Nay, that I know not. For if I go back to our village he will
find me there; and if I find out some hiding-place he will seek me
out and find me; I shall never know rest or peace again. For of
one thing am I resolved&mdash;I will die&mdash;yea, I will indeed die&mdash;before
I will become his wife more than I am at present.'</p>

<p>'I cannot but commend that resolution, Madam. But, to be
plain with you, there is no place in the world more unsafe for you
than Taunton at this time. Therefore, if you please, I will ride
with you to Bristol without delay.'</p>

<p>'Sir, I cannot ask this sacrifice of your business.'</p>

<p>'My business lies at Bristol. I can do no more here until
Judge Jeffreys hath got through his hangings, of which, I fear,
there may be many, and so more sinful waste of good convicts.
Let us, therefore, hasten away as quickly as may be; as for what
shall be done afterwards, that we will consider on the way.'</p>

<p>Did ever a woman in misfortune meet with so good a man?
The Samaritan himself was not of better heart.</p>

<p>Well, to be brief, half an hour afterwards we mounted and rode
to Bristol, by way of Bridgwater (this town was even more melancholy
than Taunton), taking three days; the weather being now
wet and rainy, so that the ways were bad. Now, as we rode along&mdash;Mr.
Penne and I&mdash;side by side, and his servant behind, armed
with a blunderbuss, our conversation was grave, turning chiefly on
the imprudence of the people in following Monmouth, when they
should have waited for the gentry to lead the way. I found my
companion (whom I held to be my benefactor) sober in manners
and in conversation; no drunkard; no user of profane oaths; and
towards me, a woman whom he had (so to say) in his own power,
he behaved always with the greatest ceremony and politeness. So
that I hoped to have found in this good man a true protector.</p>

<p>When we reached Bristol he told me that, for my better safety,
he would lodge me apart from his own house; and so took me to a
house in Broad Street, near St. John's Gate, where there was a most
respectable old lady of grave aspect, though red in the cheeks.</p>

<p>'I have brought you, Madam,' he said, 'to the house of a lady
whose virtue and piety are well known.'</p>

<p>'Sir,' said the old lady, 'this house is well known for the piety
of those who use it. And everybody knows that you are all goodness.'</p>

<p>'No,' said Mr. Penne; 'no man is good. We can but try our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
best. In this house, however, Madam, you will be safe. I beg and
implore you not at present to stir abroad, for reasons which you
very well know. This good woman has three or four daughters in
the house, who are sometimes, I believe, merry&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Sir,' said the old lady, 'children will be foolish.'</p>

<p>'True, true,' he replied laughing. 'Take care, then, that they
molest not Madam.'</p>

<p>'No, Sir; they shall not.'</p>

<p>'Then, Madam, for the moment I leave you. Rest and be easy
in your mind. I have, I think, contrived a plan which will answer
your case perfectly.'</p>

<p>In the evening he returned and sent me word, very ceremoniously,
that he desired the favour of a conversation with me. As if
there could be anything in the world that I desired more!</p>

<p>'Madam,' he said, 'I have considered carefully your case, and I
can find but one advice to give.'</p>

<p>'What is it, Sir?'</p>

<p>'We might,' he went on, 'find a lodging for you in some quiet
Welsh town across the Channel. At Chepstow, for instance, or at
Newport, you might find a home for a while. But, the country
being greatly inflamed with dissensions, there would everywhere be
the danger of some fanatical busybody inquiring into your history&mdash;whence
you came, why you left your friends&mdash;and so forth. And,
again, in every town there are women (saving your presence,
Madam), whose tongues tittle-tattle all day long. Short work they
make of a stranger. So that I see not much safety in a small town.
Then, again, you might find a farm-house where they would receive
you; but your case is not that you wish to be hidden for a time, as
one implicated in the Monmouth business. Not so; you desire to
be hidden all your life, or for the whole life of the man who, if he
finds you, may compel you to live with him, and to live for&mdash;how
long? Sixty years, perhaps, in a dull and dirty farm-house, among
rude boors, would be intolerable to a person of your manners and
accomplishments.'</p>

<p>'Then, Sir, in the name of Heaven'&mdash;for I began to be wearied
with this lengthy setting up of plans only to pull them down again&mdash;'what
shall I do?'</p>

<p>'You might go to London. At first I thought that London
offered the best hope of safe retreat. There are parts of London
where the gentlemen of the robe are never seen, and where you
might be safe. Thus, about the eastern parts of the city there are
never any lawyers at all. There you might be safe. But yet&mdash;it
would be a perpetual risk. Your face, Madam, if I may say so, is
one which will not be quickly forgotten when it hath once been
seen&mdash;you would be persecuted by would-be lovers; you would go
in continual terror, knowing that one you fear was living only a
mile away from you. You would have to make up some story, to
maintain which would be troublesome; and presently the time<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
would come when you would have no more money. What, then,
would you do?'</p>

<p>'Pray, Sir, if you can, tell me what you think I should do,
since there are so many things that I cannot do.'</p>

<p>'Madam, I am going to submit to you a plan which seems to
me at once the safest and the best. You have, you tell me, cousins
in the town of Boston, which is in New England.'</p>

<p>'Yes, I have heard my father speak of his cousins.'</p>

<p>'I have myself visited that place, and have heard mention of
certain Eykins as gentlemen of substance and reputation. I propose,
Madam, that you should go to these cousins, and seek a home
among them.'</p>

<p>'Leave England? You would have me leave this country and
go across the ocean to America?'</p>

<p>'That is my advice. Nay, Madam'&mdash;he assumed a most serious
manner&mdash;'do not reject this advice suddenly; sleep upon it. You
are not going among strangers, but among your own people, by
whom the name of your pious and learned father is doubtless held
in great honour. You are going from a life (at best) of danger and
continual care to a place where you will be certainly free from
persecution. Madam, sleep upon it.'</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXIII.</h2>

<h3>ON BOARD THE JOLLY THATCHER.</h3>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 249px;">
<img src="images/i_247.jpg" width="249" height="350" alt="I lay" />
</div>

<p>I lay awake all night thinking
of this plan. The more
I thought upon it, the
more I was pleased with
it. To fly from the country
was to escape the pursuit
of my husband, who
would never give over
looking for me because
he was so obstinate and
masterful. I should also
escape the reproaches of
my lover, Robin, and break myself
altogether from a passion which was
now (through my own rashness) become
sinful. I might also break
myself from the loathing and hatred
which I now felt towards my wicked husband,
and might even, in time and after
much prayer, arrive at forgiving him. At
that time&mdash;yea, and for long afterwards&mdash;I
did often surprise myself in such a fit of
passion as, I verily believe, would have
made me a murderess had opportunity or
the Evil One sent that man my way. Yea,
not once or twice, but many times have I
thus become a murderess in thought and
wish and intention&mdash;I confess this sin with shame, though I have
long since repented of it. To have been so near unto it&mdash;nay,
to have already committed it in my imagination, covers me
with shame. And now when I sometimes (my Lord, the master
of my affections, doth allow it) visit the Prison of Ilchester and
find therein some poor wretch who hath yielded to temptation
and sudden wrath (which is the possession by the Devil), and so
hath committed what I only imagined, my heart goes forth to that
poor creature, and I cannot rest until I have prayed with her and
softened her heart, and left her to go contrite to the shameful tree.
Nay, since, as you shall hear, I have been made to pass part of my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
life among the most wicked and profligate of my sex, I am filled
with the thought that the best of us are not much better than the
worst, and that the worst of us are in some things as good as the
best; so that there is no room for pride and self-sufficiency, but
much for humiliation and distrust of one's own heart.</p>

<p>Well, if I would consent to fly from the country; across the
seas, I should find kith and kin who would shelter me. There
should I learn to think about other things&mdash;poor wretch, as if I
could ever forget the village&mdash;and Robin! Oh! that I should
have to try&mdash;even to try&mdash;to forget Robin! I was to learn that
though the skies be changed the heart remains the same.</p>

<p>How I fled&mdash;and whither&mdash;you shall now hear.</p>

<p>Mr. George Penne came to see me next morning, sleek and
smiling and courteous.</p>

<p>'Madam,' he said, 'may I know your decision, if you have
yet arrived at one?'</p>

<p>'Sir, it is already made. I have slept upon it; I have prayed
upon it; I will go.'</p>

<p>'That is well. It is also most opportune, because a ship sails
this very day. It is most opportune I say&mdash;even Providential.
She will drop down the Channel with the coming tide. You will
want a few things for the voyage.'</p>

<p>'It will be winter when we arrive, and the winters in that
country are cold; I must buy some thicker clothing. Will there
be any gentlewoman on board?'</p>

<p>'Surely'&mdash;he smiled&mdash;'surely. There will be, I am told, more
than one gentlewoman on board that ship. There will be, in fact,
a large and a cheerful company. Of that you may be assured.
Well, since that is settled, a great load of care is removed, because
I have heard that your husband rode into Taunton with Judge
Jeffreys; that he learned from someone&mdash;I know not from whom&mdash;of
your presence in the town, and of your departure with me.'</p>

<p>'It must have been the market-woman.'</p>

<p>'Doubtless the market-woman'&mdash;I have often asked myself
whether this was a falsehood or not&mdash;'and he is even now speeding
towards Bristol hoping to find you. Pray Heaven that he hath
not learned with whom you fled!'</p>

<p>'Oh!' I cried. 'Let us go on board the ship at once! Let us
hasten!'</p>

<p>'Nay; there is no hurry for a few hours. But stay withindoors.
Everything that is wanted for the voyage shall be put on
board for you. As for your meals, you will eat with'&mdash;here he
paused for a moment&mdash;'with the rest of the company under the
care of the Captain. For your berth, it will be as comfortable as
can be provided. Next, as to the money. You have, I understand,
two hundred pounds and more?'</p>

<p>I took the bag from my waist and rolled out the contents.
There were in all two hundred and forty-five pounds and a few
shillings. The rest had been expended at Ilminster.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span></p>

<p>He counted it carefully, and then replaced the money in the
bag.</p>

<p>'The Eykins of Boston, in New England,' he said, 'are
people of great credit and substance. There will be no necessity
for you to take with you this money should you wish it to be
expended to the advantage of your brother and your friends.'</p>

<p>'Take it all, kind Sir. Take it all, if so be it will help them in
their need.'</p>

<p>'Nay, that will not do, either,' he replied, smiling, his hand
still upon the bag. 'For, first, the Captain of your ship must be
paid for his passage; next, you must not go among strangers
(though your own kith and kin) with no money at all in purse.
Therefore, I will set aside (by your good leave) fifty pounds for
your private purse. So: fifty pounds. A letter to my correspondent
at Boston, which I will write, will cause him to pay you this
money on your landing. This is a safer method than to carry the
money in a bag or purse, which may be stolen. But if the letter
be lost, another can be written. We merchants, indeed, commonly
send three such letters of advice in case of shipwreck and loss of
the bags. This done, and the expenses of the voyage provided,
there remains a large sum, which, judiciously spent, will, I think,
insure for your friends from the outset the treatment reserved for
prisoners of distinction who can afford to pay&mdash;namely, on their
arrival they will be bought (as it is termed) by worthy merchants,
who (having been previously paid by me) will suffer them to live
where they please, without exacting of them the least service
or work. Their relatives at home will forward them the means
of subsistence, and so their exile will be softened for them. If
you consent thereto, Madam, I will engage that they shall be so
received, with the help of this money.'</p>

<p>If I consented, indeed! With what joy did I give my consent
to such laying out of my poor Barnaby's money! Everything
now seemed turning to the best, thanks to my new and benevolent
friend.</p>

<p>At his desire, therefore, I wrote a letter to Barnaby recommending
him to trust himself, and to advise Robin and Humphrey
to trust themselves, entirely to the good offices of this excellent
man. I informed him that I was about to cross the seas to our
cousins in New England, in order to escape the clutches of the
villain who had betrayed me. And then I told him how his
money had been bestowed, and bade him seek me when he should
be released from the Plantations (wherever they might send him)
at the town of Boston among his cousins. The letter Mr. Penne
faithfully promised to deliver. (Nota bene&mdash;the letter was never
given to Barnaby.)</p>

<p>At the same time he wrote a letter for me to give to his correspondent
at Boston, telling me that on reading that letter his friend
would instantly pay me the sum of fifty pounds.</p>

<p>Thus was the business concluded, and I could not find words, I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
told him, to express the gratitude which I felt for so much goodness
towards one who was a stranger to him. I begged him to
suffer me to repay at least the charges to which he had been put at
the inns and the stabling since he took me into his own care and
protection. But he would take nothing. 'Money,' he said, 'as
payment for such services as he had been enabled to render would
be abhorrent to his nature. Should good deeds be bought? Was
it seemly that a merchant of credit should sell an act of common
Christian charity?'</p>

<p>'What!' he asked, 'are we to see a poor creature in danger
of being imprisoned if she is recognised&mdash;and of being carried off
against her will by a husband whom she loathes, if he finds her&mdash;are
we to see such a woman and not be instantly fired by every
generous emotion of compassion and indignation to help that
woman at the mere cost of a few days' service and a few guineas
spent?'</p>

<p>I was greatly moved&mdash;even to tears&mdash;at these words, and at all
this generosity, and I told him that I could not sufficiently thank
him for all he had done, and that he should have my prayers
always.</p>

<p>'I hope I may, Madam,' he said, smiling strangely. 'When
the ship hath sailed you will remember, perhaps, the fate of Susan
Blake, and, whatever may be your present discomfort on board a
rolling ship, say to yourself that this is better than to die in a
noisome prison. You will also understand that you have fallen
into the hands of a respectable merchant, who is much more
lenient than Judge Jeffreys, and will not consent to the wasting of
good commercial stuff in jails and on gibbets.'</p>

<p>'Nay, Sir,' I said, 'what doth all this mean?'</p>

<p>'Nothing, Madam; nothing. I was only anxious that you
should say to yourself, "Thus and thus have I been saved from a
jail."' Such was Mr. Penne's humanity!</p>

<p>'Understand it! Oh! dear Sir, I repeat that my words are not
strong enough to express my gratitude.'</p>

<p>'Now, Madam, no doubt your gratitude runs high. Whether
to-morrow&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Can I ever forget? To-morrow? To-morrow? Surely,
Sir&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Well, Madam, we will wait until to-morrow. Meantime, lie
snug and still all day, and in the afternoon I will come for you.
Two hundred and forty-five pounds&mdash;'tis not a great sum, but a
good day's work&mdash;a good day's work, added to the satisfaction of
helping a most unfortunate young gentlewoman&mdash;most unfortunate.'</p>

<p>What did the good man mean by still talking of the morrow?</p>

<p>At half-past twelve the good woman of the house brought me a
plate of meat and some bread.</p>

<p>'So,' she said&mdash;her face was red, and I think she had been
drinking&mdash;'he hath determined to put you on board with the rest,
I hear.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span></p>

<p>'Hush! If you have heard, say nothing.'</p>

<p>'He thinks he can buy my silence. Come, Madam; though,
indeed, some would rather take their chance with Judge Jeffreys&mdash;they
say he is a man who can be moved by the face of a woman&mdash;than
with&mdash;well, as for my silence, there&mdash;&mdash;It is usual, Madam,
to compliment the landlady, and though, I confess, you are not of
the kind which do commonly frequent this house, yet one may
expect'&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>'Alas! my good woman, I have nothing. Mr. Penne has taken
all my money.'</p>

<p>'What! you had money? And you gave it to Mr. Penne?
You gave it to him? Nay, indeed&mdash;why, in the place where thou
art going'&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>She was silent, for suddenly we heard Mr. Penne's step outside;
and he opened the door.</p>

<p>'Come,' he said roughly; 'the Captain says that he will weigh
anchor in an hour: the tide serves&mdash;come.'</p>

<p>I hastened to put on my hat and mantle.</p>

<p>'Farewell,' I said, taking the old woman's hand. 'I have
nothing to give thee but my prayers. Mr. Penne, who is all goodness,
will reward thee for thy kindness to me.'</p>

<p>'He all goodness?' asked the old woman. 'He? Why, if
there is upon the face of the whole earth'&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>'Come, Child!' Mr. Penne seized my hand and dragged me
away.</p>

<p>'The woman,' he said, 'hath been drinking. It is a bad habit
she hath contracted of late. I must see into it, and speak seriously
to her: but a good nature at heart. Come, we must hasten. You
will be under the special care of the Captain. I have provided a
box full of warm clothing and other comforts. I think there is
nothing omitted that may be of use. Come.'</p>

<p>He hurried me along the narrow streets until we came to a
quay, where there were a great number of ships, such as I had never
before seen. On one of them the sailors were running about clearing
away things, coiling ropes, tossing sacks and casks aboard,
with such a 'Yo-hoing!' and noise as I never in my life heard
before.</p>

<p>''Tis our ship,' said Mr. Penne. Then he led me along a narrow
bridge, formed by a single plank, to the deck of the ship.
There stood a gentleman of a very fierce and resolute aspect, armed
with a sword, hanging from a scarlet sash, and a pair of pistols in
his belt. 'Captain,' said Mr. Penne, 'are all aboard?'</p>

<p>'Ay; we have all our cargo. And a pretty crew they are! Is
this the last of them? Send her for'ard.'</p>

<p>'Madam,' said Mr. Penne, 'suffer me to lead you to a place
where, until the ship sails and the officers have time to take you to
your cabin, you can rest and be out of the way. It is a rough
assemblage, but at sailing one has no choice.'</p>

<p>Gathered in the forepart of what they call the waist there was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
a company of about a hundred people. Some were young, some
old; some were men, some women; some seemed mere children.
All alike showed in their faces the extreme of misery, apprehension,
and dismay.</p>

<p>'Who are these?' I asked.</p>

<p>'They will tell you themselves presently. Madam, farewell.'
With that Mr. Penne left me standing among this crowd of
wretches, and, without waiting for my last words of gratitude,
hurried away immediately.</p>

<p>I saw him running across the plank to the quay. Then the
boatswain blew a shrill whistle; the plank was shoved over; some
ropes were cast loose, and the ship began slowly to move down the
river with the tide, now beginning to run out, and a wind from the
north-east.</p>

<p>I looked about me. What were all these people? Why were
they going to New England? Then, as the deck was now clearer,
and the sailors, I suppose, at their stations, I ventured to walk towards
the afterpart of the ship with the intention to ask the Captain
for my cabin. As I did so, a man stood before me armed with a
great cane, which he brandished, threatening, with a horrid oath,
to lay it across my back if I ventured any further aft.</p>

<p>'Prisoners, for'ard!' he cried. 'Back you go, or&mdash;by the
Lord'&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>'Prisoner?' I said. 'I am no prisoner. I am a passenger.'</p>

<p>'Passenger? Why, as for that, you are all passengers.'</p>

<p>'All? Who are these, then?'</p>

<p>He informed me with plainness of speech who and what they
were&mdash;convicts taken from the prisons, branded in the hand, and
sentenced to transportation.</p>

<p>'But I am a passenger,' I repeated. 'Mr. Penne hath paid for
my passage to New England. He hath paid the Captain'&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>'The ship is bound for Barbadoes, not New England. 'Tis my
duty not to stir from this spot; but here's the Mate&mdash;tell him.'</p>

<p>This was a young man, armed, like the Captain, with pistols and
sword.</p>

<p>'Sir,' I said, 'I am a passenger brought on board by Mr. Penne,
by whom my passage hath been paid to New England.'</p>

<p>'By Mr. George Penne, you say?'</p>

<p>'The same. He hath engaged a cabin for me, and hath purchased
clothes&mdash;and'&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>'Is it possible,' said the Mate, 'that you do not know where you
are, and whither you are going?'</p>

<p>'I am going, under the special care of the Captain, to the city
of Boston, in New England, to my cousin, Mr. Eykin, a gentleman
of credit and substance of that town.'</p>

<p>He gazed at me with wonder.</p>

<p>'I will speak to the Captain,' he said, and left me standing
there.</p>

<p>Presently he returned. 'Come with me,' he said.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span></p>

<p>'You are Alice Eykin?' said the Captain, who had with him a
paper from which he read.</p>

<p>'That is my name.'</p>

<p>'On a certain day in July, your father being a preacher in the
army of the Duke of Monmouth, you walked with a procession of
girls bearing flags which you presented to that rebel?'</p>

<p>'It is true, Sir.'</p>

<p>'You have been given by the King to some great Lord or other,
I know not whom, and by him sold to the man Penne, who hath
put you on board this ship, the "Jolly Thatcher," Port of London,
to be conveyed, with a hundred prisoners, all rogues and thieves, to
the Island of Barbadoes, where you will presently be sold as a servant
for ten years; after which period, if you choose, you will be
at liberty to return to England.'</p>

<p>Then, indeed, the Captain before me seemed to reel about, and
I fell fainting at his feet.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXIV.</h2>

<h3>THE GOOD SAMARITAN.</h3>


<div class="drop">
<img src="images/i_254.jpg" alt="T" width="100" height="100" class="cap" />
 <p class="cap_1">This was indeed the truth: I had parted with my money
on the word of a villain; I put myself into his power
by telling him the whole of my sad story; and, on the
promise of sending me by ship to my cousins in New
England, he had entered my name as a rebel sold to
himself (afterwards I learned that he made it appear as if I was
one of the hundred given to Mr. Jerome Nipho, all of whom he
afterwards bought and sent to the Plantations), and he had then
shipped me on board a vessel on the point of sailing with as vile a
company of rogues, vagabonds, thieves, and drabs as were ever
raked together out of the streets and the prisons.</p>
</div>

<p>When I came to my senses the Captain gave me a glass of
cordial, and made me sit down on a gun-carriage while he asked me
many questions. I answered him all truthfully, concealing only the
reason of my flight and of my visit to Taunton, where, I told him
truly, I hoped to see my unhappy friend Miss Susan Blake, of
whose imprisonment and death I knew nothing.</p>

<p>'Madam,' said the Captain, stroking his chin, 'your case is
indeed a hard one. Yet your name is entered on my list, and I
must deliver your body at St. Michael's Port, Barbadoes, or account
for its absence. This must I do: I have no other choice. As for
your being sold to Mr. George Penne by Mr. Jerome Nipho, this
may very well be without your knowing even that you had been
given to that gentleman by the King. They say that the Maids of
Taunton have all been given away, mostly to the Queen's Maids of
Honour, and must either be redeemed at a great price or be sold as
you have been. On the other hand, there may be villainy, and in
this case it might be dangerous for you to move in the matter lest
you be apprehended and sent to jail as a rebel, and so a worse fate
happen unto you.'</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 404px;">
<img src="images/i_255.jpg" width="404" height="600" alt="senses" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">'<i>When I came to my senses the captain gave me a glass of cordial.</i>'</p></div>
</div>

<p>He then went on to tell me that this pretended merchant, this
Mr. George Penne, was the most notorious kidnapper in the whole
of Bristol; that he was always raking the prisons of rogues and
sending them abroad for sale on the Plantations; that at this time
he was looking to make a great profit, because there were so many
prisoners that all could not be hanged, but most must be either
flogged and sent about their business, or else sold to him and his
like for servitude. 'As for any money paid for your passage,' he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
went on, 'I assure you, Madam, upon my honour, that nothing at
all has been paid by him; nor has he provided you with any change
of clothes or provisions of any kind for the voyage; nor hath he
asked or bargained for any better treatment of you on board than is
given to the rogues below; and that, Madam,' he added, 'is food
of the coarsest, and planks, for sleep, of the hardest. The letter
which you have shown me is a mere trick. I do not think there is
any such person in Boston. It is true, however, that there is a family
of your name in Boston, and that they are substantial merchants.
I make no doubt that as he hath treated you, so he will treat your
friends; and that all the money which he has taken from you will
remain in his own pocket.'</p>

<p>'Then,' I cried, 'what am I to do? Where look for help?'</p>

<p>''Tis the damnedest villain!' cried the Captain, swearing after
the profane way of sailors. 'When next I put in at the Port of
Bristol, if the Monmouth scare be over, I will take care that all
the world shall know what he hath done. But, indeed, he will not
care. The respectable merchants have nothing to say with him&mdash;he
is now an open Catholic, who was formerly concealed in that religion.
Therefore, he thinks his fortune is at the flood. But what is to be
done, Madam?'</p>

<p>'Indeed, Sir, I know not.'</p>

<p>He considered a while. His face was rough and coloured like a
ripe plum with the wind and the sun; but he looked honest, and
he did not, like Mr. Penne, pretend to shed tears over my misfortunes.</p>

<p>'Those who join rebellions,' he said, but not unkindly, 'generally
find themselves out in their reckoning in the end. What the
deuce have gentlewomen to do with the pulling down of Kings! I
warrant, now, you thought you were doing a grand thing, and so
you must needs go walking with those pretty fools, the Maids of
Taunton! Well; 'tis past praying for. George Penne is such a
villain that keelhauling is too good for him. Flogged through the
fleet at Spithead he should be. Madam, I am not one who favours
rebels; yet you cannot sleep and mess with the scum down yonder.
'Twould be worse than inhuman&mdash;their talk and their manners
would kill you. There is a cabin aft which you can have. The
furniture is mean, but it will be your own while you are aboard.
You shall mess at my table if you will so honour me. You shall
have the liberty of the quarter-deck. I will also find for you, if I
can, among the women aboard, one somewhat less villainous than
the rest, who shall be your grumeta, as the Spaniards say&mdash;your
servant, that is&mdash;to keep your cabin clean and do your bidding.
When we make Barbadoes there is no help for it, but you must go
ashore with the rest and take your chance.'</p>

<p>This was truly generous of the Captain, and I thanked him with
all my heart. He proved as good as his word, for though he was a
hard man, who duly maintained discipline, flogging his prisoners
with rigour, he treated me during the whole voyage with kindness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
and pity, never forgetting daily to curse the name of George Penne
and drink to his confusion.</p>

<p>The voyage lasted six weeks. At first we had rough weather
with heavy seas and rolling waves. Happily, I was not made sick
by the motion of the ship, and could always stand upon the deck
and look at the waves (a spectacle, to my mind, the grandest in the
whole world). But, I fear, there was much suffering among the
poor wretches&mdash;my fellow-prisoners. They were huddled and
crowded together below the deck; they were all sea-sick; there
was no doctor to relieve their sufferings, nor were there any medicines
for those who were ill. Fever presently broke out among
them, so that we buried nine in the first fortnight of our voyage.
After this, the weather growing warm and the sea moderating, the
sick mended rapidly, and soon all were well again.</p>

<p>I used to stand upon the quarter-deck and look at them gathered
in the waist below. Never had I seen such a company. They came,
I heard, principally from London, which is the rendezvous or headquarters
of all the rogues in the country. They were all in rags&mdash;had
any one among them possessed a decent coat it would have been
snatched from his back the very first day; they were dirty from the
beginning; many of them had cuts and wounds on their heads
gotten in their fights and quarrels, and these were bound about with
old clouts; their faces were not fresh-coloured and rosy, like the
faces of our honest country lads, but pale and sometimes covered
with red blotches, caused by their evil lives and their hard drinking;
on their foreheads was clearly set the seal of Satan. Never
did I behold wickedness so manifestly stamped upon the human
countenance. They were like monkeys for their knavish and thievish
tricks. They stole everything that they could lay hands upon:
pieces of rope, the sailors' knives when they could get them, even
the marlinspikes if they were left about. When they were caught
and flogged they would make the ship terrible with their shrieks,
being cowards as prodigious as they were thieves. They lay about
all day ragged and dirty on deck, in the place assigned to them,
stupidly sleeping or else silent and dumpish, except for some of the
young fellows who gambled with cards&mdash;I know not for what stakes&mdash;and
quarrelled over the game and fought. It was an amusement
among the sailors to make these lads fight on the forecastle, promising
a pannikin of rum to the victor. For this miserable prize they
would fight with the greatest fury and desperation, even biting one
another in their rage, while the sailors clapped their hands and
encouraged them. Pity it is that the common sort do still delight
themselves with sport so brutal. On shore these fellows would be
rejoicing in cock-fights and bull-baitings: on board they baited the
prisoners.</p>

<p>There were among the prisoners twenty or thirty women, the
sweepings of the Bristol streets. They, too, would fight as readily
as the men, until the Captain forbade it under penalty of a flogging.
These women were to the full as wicked as the men; nay, their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
language was worse, insomuch that the very sailors would stand
aghast to hear the blasphemies they uttered, and would even remonstrate
with them, saying, 'Nan,' or 'Poll'&mdash;they were all Polls
and Nans&mdash;''tis enough to cause the ship to be struck with lightning!
Give over, now! Wilt sink the ship's company with your
foul tongue?' But the promise of a flogging kept them from fighting.
Men, I think, will brave anything for a moment's gratification;
but not even the most hardened woman will willingly risk the pain
of the whip.</p>

<p>The Captain told me that of these convicts, of whom every year
whole shiploads are taken to Virginia, to Jamaica, and to Barbadoes,
not one in a hundred ever returns. 'For,' he said, 'the
work exacted from them is so severe, with so much exposure to a
burning sun, and the fare is so hard, that they fall into fevers and
calentures. And, besides the dangers from the heat and the bad
food, there is a drink called rum, or arrack, which is distilled from
the juice of the sugar-cane, and another drink called "mobbie,"
distilled from potatoes, which inflames their blood, and causes
many to die before their time. Moreover, the laws are harsh, and
there is too much flogging and branding and hanging. So that
some fall into despair and, in that condition of mind, die under
the first illness which seizes on them.'</p>

<p>'Captain,' I said, 'you forget that I am also to become one of
these poor wretches.'</p>

<p>The Captain swore lustily that, on his return, he would seek
out the villain Penne and break his neck for him. Then he assured
me that the difference between myself and the common herd would
be immediately recognised; that a rebel is not a thief, and must
not be so treated; and that I had nothing to fear&mdash;nay, that he
himself would say what he could in my favour. But he entreated
me with the utmost vehemence to send home an account of where
I was, and what I was enduring, to such of my friends as might
have either money to relieve me from servitude or interest to procure
a pardon. Alas! I had no friends. Mr. Boscorel, I knew
full well, would move heaven and earth to help me. But he could
not do that without his son finding out where I was; and this
thought so moved me that I implored the Captain to tell no one
who I was, or what was my history; and, for greater persuasion, I
revealed to him those parts of my history which I had hitherto
concealed, namely, my marriage and the reason of that rash step
and my flight.</p>

<p>'Madam,' he said, 'I would that I had the power of revenging
these foul wrongs. For them, I swear, I would kidnap both Mr.
George Penne and Mr. Benjamin Boscorel; and, look you, I would
make them mess with the scum and the sweepings whom we carry
for'ard; and I would sell them to the most inhuman of the planters,
by whom they would be daily beaten and cuffed and flogged;
or, better still, would cause them to be sold at Havana to the
Spaniards, where they would be employed, as are the English<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
prisoners commonly by that cruel people, namely, in fetching water
under negro overseers. I leave you to imagine how long they
would live, and what terrible treatment they would receive.'</p>

<p>So it was certain that I was going to a place where I must look
for very little mercy, unless I could buy it; and where the white
servant was regarded as worth so many years of work; not so much
as a negro, because he doth sooner sink under the hardships of his
lot, while the negro continues frolick and lusty, and marries and
has children, even though he has to toil all day in the sun, and is
flogged continually to make him work with the greater heart.</p>

<p>Among the women on board was a young woman, not more
than eighteen or thereabout, who was called Deb. She had no
other name. Her birthplace she knew not; but she had run about
the country with some tinkers, whose language she said is called
'Shelta' by those people. This she could still talk. They sold
her in Bristol; after which her history is one which, I learn, is
common in towns. When the Captain bade her come to the
cabin, and ordered her to obey me in whatsoever I commanded,
she looked stupidly at him, shrinking from him if he moved, as if
she was accustomed (which was indeed the case) to be beaten at
every word. I made her first clean herself and wash her clothes.
This done, she slept in my cabin, and, as the Captain promised,
became my servant. At first she was not only afraid of ill-treatment,
but she would wilfully lie; she purloined things and
hid them; she told me so many tales of her past life, all of them
different, that I could believe none. Yet when she presently
found out that I was not going to beat her, and that the Captain
did never offer to cuff or kick her (which the poor wretch expected),
she left off telling falsehoods and became as handy, obliging, and
useful a creature as one could desire. She was a great, strapping
girl, black-eyed and with black hair, as strong as any man, and a
good-looking creature as well, to those who like great women.</p>

<p>This Deb, when, I say, she ceased to be afraid of me, began to
tell me her true history, which was, I suppose, only remarkable
because she seemed not to know that it was shameful and wicked.
She lived, as the people among whom she had been brought up
lived, without the least sense or knowledge of God; indeed, no
heathen savage could be more without religion than the tinkers
and gipsies on the road. They have no knowledge at all; they
are born; they live; they die; they are buried in a hedgeside, and
are forgotten. It was surprising to me to find that any woman
could grow up in a Christian country so ignorant and so uncared
for. In the end, as you shall hear, she showed every mark of
penitence and fell into a godly and pious life.</p>

<p>My Captain continued in the same kindness towards me
throughout the voyage&mdash;suffering me to mess at his table, where
the provisions were plain but wholesome, and encouraging me to
talk to him, seeming to take pleasure in my simple conversation.
In the mornings when, with a fair wind and full sail, the ship<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
ploughed through the water, while the sun was hot overhead, he
would make me a seat with a pillow in the shade, and would then
entreat me to tell him about the rebellion and our flight to Black
Down. Or he would encourage me in serious talk (though his own
conversation with his sailors was over-much garnished with profane
oaths), listening with grave face. And sometimes he would ask
me questions about the village of Bradford Orcas, my mother and
her wheel, Sir Christopher and the Rector, showing a wonderful
interest in everything that I told him. It was strange to see how
this man, hard as he was with the prisoners (whom it was necessary
to terrify, otherwise they might mutiny), could be so gentle
towards me, a stranger, and a costly one too, because he was at the
expense of maintaining me for the whole voyage, and the whole
time being of good manners, never rude or rough, or offering the
least freedom or familiarity&mdash;a thing which a woman in my defenceless
position naturally fears. He could not have shown more
respect unto a Queen. The Lord will surely reward him therefor.</p>

<p>One evening at sunset, when we had been at sea six weeks, he
came to me as I was sitting on the quarter-deck and pointed to
what seemed a cloud in the west. 'Tis the island of Barbadoes,'
he said. 'To-morrow, if this wind keeps fair, we shall make the
Port of St. Michael's, which some call the Bridge, and then, Madam,
alas!'&mdash;he fetched a deep sigh&mdash;'I must put you ashore and
part with the sweetest companion that ever sailed across the ocean.'</p>

<p>He said no more, but left me as if he had other things to say
but stifled them. Presently the sun went down and darkness fell
upon the waters; the wind also fell and the sea was smooth, so
that there was a great silence. 'To-morrow,' I thought, 'we shall
reach the port, and I shall be landed with these wretches and sent,
perhaps, to toil in the fields.' But yet my soul was upheld by the
vision which had been granted to me upon the Black Down Hills,
and I feared nothing. This I can say without boasting, because I
had such weighty reasons for the faith that was in me.</p>

<p>The Captain presently came back to me.</p>

<p>'Madam,' he said, 'suffer me to open my mind to you.'</p>

<p>'Sir,' I told him, 'there is nothing which I could refuse you,
saving my honour.'</p>

<p>'I must confess,' he said, 'I have been torn in twain for love of
you, Madam, ever since you did me the honour to mess at my table.
Nay, hear me out. And I have been minded a thousand times to
assure you first that your marriage is no marriage, and that you
have not indeed any husband at all; next, that since you can never
go back to your old sweetheart, 'tis better to find another who
would protect and cherish you; and thirdly, that I am ready&mdash;ay!
and longing&mdash;now to become your husband and protector, and to
love you with all my heart and soul.'</p>

<p>'Sir,' I said, 'I thank you for telling me this, which indeed I
did not suspect. But I am (alas! as you know) already married&mdash;even
though my marriage be no true one&mdash;and can never forget the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
love which I still must bear to my old sweetheart. Wherefore, I
may not listen to any talk of love.'</p>

<p>'If,' he replied, 'you were a woman after the common pattern
you would right gladly cast aside the chains of this marriage ceremony.
But, Madam, you are a saint. Therefore, I refrained.'
He sighed. 'I confess that I have been dragged as by chains to
lay myself at your feet. Well; that must not be.' He sighed
again. 'Yet I would save you, Madam, from the dangers of this
place. The merchants and planters do, for the most part, though
gentlemen of good birth, lead debauched and ungodly lives, and I
fear that, though they may spare you the hardships of the field,
they may offer you other and worse indignities.'</p>

<p>I answered in the words of David: 'The Lord hath delivered
me out of the paw of the lion, and out of the paw of the bear:
He will deliver me out of the hand of the Philistines.'</p>

<p>'Nay; but there is a way; you need not land at all. It is but
a scratch of the pen, and I will enter your name among those who
died upon the voyage. There will be no more inquiry, any more
than after the other names, and then I can carry you back with me
to the Port of London, whither I am bound after taking in my
cargo.'</p>

<p>For a space I was sorely tempted. Then I reflected. It would
be, I remembered, by consenting to the Captain's treachery towards
his employers, nothing less, that I could escape this lot.</p>

<p>'No, Sir,' I said, 'I thank you from my heart for all your kindness
and for your forbearance; but we may not consent together
unto this sin. Again, I thank you, but I must suffer what is laid
upon me.'</p>

<p>He knelt at my feet and kissed my hands, saying nothing more,
and presently I went to my cabin, and so ended my first voyage
across the great Atlantic Ocean. In the morning when I awoke,
we were beating off Carlisle Bay, and I felt like unto one of those
Christian martyrs, of whom I have read, whom they were about to
lead forth and cast unto the lions.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXV.</h2>

<h3>THE WHITE SLAVE.</h3>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 253px;">
<img src="images/i_263.jpg" width="253" height="350" alt="When" />
</div>

<p>When we dropped anchor
in the port or road of Carlisle
Bay we were boarded
by a number of gentlemen,
who welcomed the
Captain, asked him the
news, and drank with him.
I meantime kept in my
cabin, knowing that I must
shortly come forth; and
presently I heard the boatswain's
pipe, and the order to all
the prisoners to come on deck.
Then one knocked softly at my
door. It was the Captain.</p>

<p>'Madam,' he said, with a troubled
voice, 'it is not too late. Suffer me, I
pray you, to enter your name as one
of those who died on the voyage. It is
no great deception: the villain Penne
will alone be hurt by it; and I swear
to take you home, and to place you
until better times with honest and
Godfearing people in London.'</p>

<p>'Oh! Sir!' I replied, 'tempt me
not, I pray you. Let me go forth and
take my place among the rest.'</p>

<p>He entreated me again, but, finding that he could not prevail,
he suffered me to come out. Yet, such was his kindness to the
last that he would not place me with the rest, but caused his men
to give me a chair on the quarter-deck. Then I saw that we were
all to be sold. The prisoners were drawn up standing in lines one
behind the other, the men on one side and the women on the other.
The hardships of the voyage had brought them so low that, what
with their rags and dirt, and their dull scowls and savage faces, and
their thin, pale cheeks, they presented a forbidding appearance
indeed.</p>

<p>Three or four gentlemen (they were, I found, planters of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
island) were examining them, ordering them to lift up their arms,
stretch out their legs, open their mouths, and, in short, treating
them like so many cattle: at which the women laughed with ribald
words, but the men looked as if they would willingly, if they
dared, take revenge.</p>

<p>'Faugh!' cried one of the planters. 'Here is a goodly collection
indeed! The island is like to become the dust-heap of Great
Britain, where all the rubbish may be shot. Captain, how long
before these bags of bones will drop to pieces? Well, sweet ladies
and fair gentlemen'&mdash;he made a mock bow to the prisoners&mdash;'you
are welcome. After the voyage, a little exercise will do you good.
You will find the air of the fields wholesome; and the gentlewomen,
I assure you, will discover that the drivers and overseers
will willingly oblige any who want to dance with a skipping-rope.'</p>

<p>There were now twenty or thirty gentlemen, all of them merchants
and planters, on board, and a man stepped forward with a
book and pencil in hand, who was, I perceived, the salesman.</p>

<p>'Gentlemen,' he said, 'this parcel of servants' (he called them
a parcel, as if they were a bale of dry goods) 'is consigned to my
care by Mr. George Penne, of Bristol, their owner. They are
partly from that city and partly from London, though shipped at
the port of Bristol. A tedious voyage, following after a long imprisonment
in Newgate and Bridewell, hath, it is true, somewhat
reduced them. But there are among them, as you will find on
examination, many lusty fellows and stout wenches, and I doubt
not that what you buy to-day will hereafter prove good bargains.
They are to be sold without reserve, and to the highest bidder.
Robert Bull'&mdash;he read the first name on the list&mdash;'Robert Bull,
shoplifter. Stand forth, Robert Bull.'</p>

<p>There arose from the deck where he had been lying a poor
wretch who looked as if he could hardly stand, wasted with fever
and privation, his eyes hollow (yet they looked full of wicked cunning).
The planters shook their heads.</p>

<p>'Come, gentlemen,' said the salesman, 'we must not judge by
appearances. He is at present, no doubt, weak, but not so weak
as he looks. I warrant a smart cut or two of the whip would show
another man. Who bids for Robert Bull?'</p>

<p>He was sold after a little parley for the sum of five pounds.
Then the speaker called another, naming his offence as a qualification.
No pillory could be more shameful. Yet the men looked
dogged and the women laughed.</p>

<p>The sale lasted for three or four hours, the prisoners being
knocked down, as they say, for various sums, the greatest price
being given for those women who were young and strong. The
reason, I have been told, is that the women make better servants,
endure the heat more patiently, do not commonly drink the strong
spirit which destroys the men, and, though they are not so strong,
do more work.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 404px;">
<img src="images/i_265.jpg" width="404" height="600" alt="bareheaded" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">'<i>This I did, and so stood before them all bareheaded.</i>'</p></div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span></p>

<p>Last of all, the man called my name. 'Alice Eykin, Rebel.
Stand forth, Alice Eykin, Rebel.'</p>

<p>'Do not go down among them,' said the Captain. 'Let them
see at once that yours is no common case. Stand here.'</p>

<p>He led me to the top of the ladder or steps which they call the
companion&mdash;leading from the waist to the quarter-deck.</p>

<p>'Madam,' he said, 'it will be best to throw back your
hood.'</p>

<p>This I did, and so stood before them all bareheaded.</p>

<p>Oh! ye who are women of gentle nurture, think of such a
thing as this: to stand exposed to the curious gaze of rough and
ribald men; to be bought and sold like a horse or an ox at the
fair! At first my eyes swam and I saw nothing, and should have
fallen but that the Captain placed his hand upon my arm, and so I
was steadied. Then my sight cleared, and I could look down upon
the faces of the men below. There was no place whither I could
fly and hide. It would be more shameful still (because it might
make them laugh) to burst into tears. Why, I thought, why had
I not accepted the Captain's offer and suffered my name to be
entered as one of those who had died on the voyage and been
buried in the sea?</p>

<p>Down in the waist the gentlemen gazed and gasped, in astonishment.
It was no new thing for the planters to buy political
prisoners. Oliver Cromwell sent over a shipload of Irishmen first,
and another shipload of those engaged in the rising of Penruddock
and Grove (among them were gentlemen, divines, and officers, of
whom a few yet survived on the island). But as yet no gentlewoman
at all had been sent out for political reasons. Wherefore,
I suppose, they looked so amazed, and gazed first at me and then at
one another and then gasped for breath.</p>

<p>'Alice Eykin, gentlemen,' said the salesman, who had a tongue
which, as they say, ran upon wheels, 'is a young gentlewoman, the
daughter, I am informed, of the Rev. Comfort Eykin, Doctor of
Divinity, deceased, formerly Rector of Bradford Orcas, in the
county of Somerset, and sometime Fellow of his college at Oxford,
a very learned Divine. She hath had the misfortune to have taken
part in the Monmouth Rebellion, and was one of those Maids of
Taunton who gave the Duke his flags, as you have heard by the
latest advices. Therefore, she is sent abroad for a term of ten
years. Gentlemen, there can be no doubt that her relations will
not endure that this young lady&mdash;as beautiful as she is unfortunate,
and as tender as she is beautiful&mdash;should be exposed to the same
hard treatment as the rogues and thieves whom you have just had
put up for sale. They will, I am privately assured'&mdash;I heard this
statement with amazement&mdash;'gladly purchase her freedom, after
which, unless she is permitted to return, the society of our Colony
will rejoice in the residence among them of one so lovely and so
accomplished. Meantime, she must be sold like the rest.'</p>

<p>'Did Monmouth make war with women for his followers?'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
asked a gentleman of graver aspect than most. 'I, for one, will
have no part or share in such traffic. Are English gentlewomen,
because their friends are rebels, to be sent into the fields with the
negroes?'</p>

<p>'Your wife would be jealous,' said another, and then they all
laughed.</p>

<p>I understood not until afterwards that the buying and selling
of such a person as I appeared to be is a kind of gambling. That
is to say, the buyer hopes to get his profit, not by any work that
his servant should do, but by the ransom that his friends at home
should offer. And so they began to bid, with jokes rude and unseemly,
and much laughter, while I stood before them still bareheaded.</p>

<p>'Ten pounds,' one began; 'Twelve,' cried another; 'Fifteen,'
said a third; and so on, the price continually rising, and the
salesman with honeyed tongue continually declaring that my friends
(as he very well knew) would consent to give any ransom&mdash;any&mdash;so
only that I was set free from servitude: until, for sixty pounds,
no one offering a higher price, I was sold to one whose appearance
I liked the least of any. He was a gross, fat man, with puffed
cheeks and short neck, who had bought already about twenty of
the servants.</p>

<p>'Be easy,' he said, to one who asked him how he looked to get
his money back. 'It is not for twice sixty pounds that I will
consent to let her go. What is twice sixty pounds for a lovely
piece like this?'</p>

<p>Then the Captain, who had stood beside me, saying nothing,
interfered.</p>

<p>'Madam,' he said, 'you can put up your hood again. And
harkee, Sir,' he spoke to the planter, 'remember that this is a
pious and virtuous gentlewoman, and'&mdash;here he swore a round
oath&mdash;'if I hear when I make this port again that you have offered
her the least freedom&mdash;you shall answer to me for it. Gentlemen
all,' he went on, 'I verily believe that you will shortly have the
greatest windfall that hath ever happened to you, compared with
which the Salisbury Rising was but a flea-bite. For the trials of
the Monmouth rebels were already begun when I left the port of
Bristol, and, though the Judges are sentencing all alike to death,
they cannot hang them all&mdash;therefore his Majesty's Plantations,
and Barbadoes in particular, will not only have whole cargoes of
stout and able-bodied servants, compared with whom these poor
rogues are like so many worthless weeds; but there will also be
many gentlemen, and perhaps gentlewomen&mdash;like Madam here&mdash;whose
freedom will be bought of you. So that I earnestly advise
and entreat you not to treat them cruelly, but with gentleness and
forbearance, whereby you will be the gainers in the end, and will
make their friends the readier to find the price of ransom. Moreover,
you must remember that though gentlemen may be flogged
at whipping-posts, and beat over the head with canes, as is your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
habit with servants both black and white, when the time of their
deliverance arrives they will be no longer slaves but gentlemen
again, and able once more to stand upon the point of honour and
to run you through the body, as you will richly deserve, for your
barbarity. And in the same way any gentlewomen who may be
sent here have brothers and cousins who will be ready to perform
the same act of kindness on their behalf. Remember that very
carefully, gentlemen, if you please.'</p>

<p>The Captain spoke to all the gentlemen present, but in the last
words he addressed himself particularly unto my new master. It
was a warning likely to be very serviceable, the planters being one
and all notoriously addicted to beating and whipping their servants.
And I have no doubt that these words did a great deal towards
assuring for the unfortunate gentlemen who presently arrived such
consideration and good treatment as they would not otherwise have
received.</p>

<p>The island of Barbadoes, as many people know, is one of the
Caribby Islands. It is, as to size, a small place, not more than
twenty miles in length by fifteen in breadth, but in population it
is a very considerable place indeed, for it is said to have as many
people in it as the City of Bristol. It is completely settled, and of
the former inhabitants not one is left. They were the people called
Indians or Caribs, and how they perished I know not. The island
had four ports, of which the principal is that of St. Michael or the
Bridge, or Bridgetown, in Carlisle Bay. The heat by day is very
great, and there is no winter, but summer all the year round. There
is, however, a cool breeze from the sea which moderates the
heat. A great number of vessels call here every year (there is said
to be one every day, but this I cannot believe). They bring to the
island all kinds of European manufactures, and take away with
them cargoes of Muscovada sugar, cotton, ginger, and logwood.
The island hath its shores covered with plantations, being (the
people say) already more thickly cultivated than any part of England,
with fewer waste places, commons, and the like. The
fruits which grow here are plentiful and delicious&mdash;such as the
pineapple, the pappau, the guava, the bonannow, and the like&mdash;but
they are not for the servants and the slaves. The fertility of
the country is truly astonishing; and the air, though full of moisture,
whereby knives and tools of all kinds quickly rust and spoil,
is considered more healthy than that of any other West Indian
island. But, for the poor creatures who have to toil in the hot
sun, the air is full of fatigue and thirst; it is laden with fevers,
calentures, and sunstrokes. Death is always in their midst; and
after death, whatever awaits them cannot, I think, be much worse
than their condition on the island.</p>

<p>After the sale was finished, the Captain bade me farewell, with
tears in his eyes, and we were taken into boats and conveyed
ashore, I, for my part, sitting beside my purchaser, who addressed
no word at all to me. I was, however, pleased to find that among<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
the people whom he had bought was the girl Deb, who had been
my maid (if a woman who is a convict may have a maid who is a
sister-convict). When we landed, we walked from the quay or
landing-place to a great building like a barn, which is called a barracoon,
in which are lodged the negro slaves and servants before
they go to their masters. But at this time it was empty. Hither
came presently a certain important person in a great wig and a
black coat, followed by two negro beadles, each carrying a long cane
or stick. After commanding silence, this officer read to us in a
loud voice those laws of the colony which concern servants, and
especially those who, like ourselves, are transported for various
offences. I forget what these laws were; but they seemed to be of
a cruel and vindictive nature, and all ended with flogging and extension
of the term of service. I remember, for instance&mdash;because
the thought of escape from a place in the middle of the ocean
seemed to me mad&mdash;that, by the law, if any one should be caught
endeavouring to run away, he should be first flogged and then
made to serve three years after his term was expired; and that no
ship was allowed to trade with the island, or to put in for water,
unless the captain had given security with two inhabitants of the
island in the sum of 2,000<em>l</em>. sterling not to carry off any servant
without the owner's consent.</p>

<p>When these laws had been read, the officer proceeded, further,
to inform us that those who were thus sent out were sent to work
as a punishment; that the work would be hard, not light; and
that those who shirked their work, or were negligent in their work,
would be reminded of their duties in the manner common to Plantations;
that if they tried to run away they would most certainly
be caught, because the island was but small; and that when they
were caught, not only would their term of years be increased, but
that they would most certainly receive a dreadful number of lashes.
He added, further, that as nothing would be gained by malingering,
sulking, or laziness, so, on the other hand, our lot might be lightened
by cheerfulness, honesty, and zeal. A more surly, ill-conditioned
crew I think he must have never before harangued. They
listened, and on most faces I read the determination to do no more
work than was forced from them. This is, I have learned, how
the plantation servants do commonly begin; but the most stubborn
spirit is not proof against the lash and starvation. Therefore, before
many days they are as active and as zealous as can be desired,
and the white men, even in the fields, will do double the work that
can be got out of the black.</p>

<p>Then this officer went away followed by his beadles, who cast
eyes of regret upon us, as if longing to stay and exercise their
wands of office upon the prisoners' backs. This done, we were
ordered to march out. My master's horse was waiting for him,
led by a negro; and two of his overseers, also mounted and carrying
whips in their hands, waited his commands. He spoke with
them a few minutes, and then rode away.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span></p>

<p>They brought a long cart with a kind of tilt to it, drawn by two
asses (here they call them assinegoes), and invited me courteously
to get into it. It was loaded with cases and boxes, and a negro
walked beside the beasts. Then we set out upon our march. First
walked the twenty servants&mdash;men and women&mdash;newly bought by
the master; after them, or at their side, rode the overseers,
roughly calling on the laggards to quicken their pace, and cracking
their whips horribly. Then came the cart in which I sat.
The sun was high in the heavens, for it was not more than three
of the clock; the road was white and covered with dust; and
the distance was about six or seven miles, and we went slowly,
so that it was already nigh unto sunset when we arrived at the
master's estate.</p>

<p>Thus was I, a gentlewoman born, sold in the Island of Barbadoes
for a slave. Sixty pounds the price I fetched. Oh! even
now, when it is all passed long since, I remember still with shame
how I stood upon the quarter-deck, my hood thrown back, while
all those men gazed upon me, and passed their ribald jests, and
cried out the money they would give for me!</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER XXXVI.</h2>

<h3>THE FIRST DAY OF SERVITUDE.</h3>


<div class="drop">
<img src="images/i_272.jpg" alt="T" width="100" height="100" class="cap" />
 <p class="cap_1">Thus began my captivity. Thus I began to sit beside
the waters of Babylon, more wretched than the
daughters of Zion, because they wept together, while
I wept alone. I looked for no release or escape until
the Lord should mercifully please to call me away
by opening the Gate of Death. For even if I were released&mdash;if by
living out the ten years of servitude I could claim my freedom, of
what use would it be to me? Whither could I fly? where hide
myself? Yet you shall hear, if you will read, how a way, terrible
at first and full of peril, was unexpectedly opened, and in what
strange manner was wrought my deliverance.</p>
</div>

<p>We arrived at our new master's estate&mdash;which was, as I have
said, about seven miles from the port&mdash;towards sundown. We
were marched (rather, driven) to a kind of village, consisting of a
double row of huts or cottages, forming a broad street, in the middle
of which there were planted a large number of the fruit-trees
named here bonannows (they are a kind of plantain). The green
fruit was hanging in clusters, as yet unripe; but the leaves, which
are also the branches, being for the most part blown into long
shreds, or rags, by the wind, had an untidy appearance. The cottages
looked more like pigsties for size and shape; they were built
of sticks, withs, and plantain-leaves both for sides and for roof.
Chimneys had they none, nor windows; some of them had no door,
but an opening only. Thus are housed the servants and slaves of
a plantation. The furniture within is such as the occupants contrive.
Sometimes there is a hammock or a pallet with grass mats
and rugs; there are some simple platters and basins. In each hut
there are two, three, or four occupants.</p>

<p>Here let me in brief make an end of describing the buildings
on this estate, which were, I suppose, like those of every other.
If you were to draw a great square, in which to lay down or figure
the buildings, you would have in one corner the street or village of
the people; next to the village lies the great pond which serves for
drinking-water as well as for washing. The negroes are fond of
swimming and bathing in it, and they say that the water is not fouled
thereby, which I cannot understand. In the opposite corner you
must place the Ingenio, or house where the sugar-canes are brought to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
be crushed and ground, and the sugar is made. There are all kinds
of machines, with great wheels, small wheels, cogs, gutters for running
the juice, and contrivances which I cannot remember. Some
of the Ingenios are worked by a windmill, others by horses and
assinegoes. There is in every one a still where they make that
fiery spirit which they call "kill-devil." Near the Ingenio are
the stables, where there are horses, oxen, assinegoes, and the
curious beast spoken of in Holy Writ called the camel. It hath
been brought here from Africa, and is much used for carrying the
sugar. The open space around the Ingenio is generally covered
and strewed with trash, which is the crushed stalk of the cane.
It always gives forth a sour smell (as if fermenting), which I cannot
think to be wholesome. In the fourth corner is the planter's house.
Considering that these people sometimes grow so rich that they
come home and buy great estates, it is wonderful that they should
consent to live in houses so mean and paltry. They are of wood,
with roofs so low that one can hardly stand upright in them; and
the people are so afraid of the cool wind which blows from the east
that they have neither doors nor windows on that side; but will
have them all towards the west, whence cometh the chief heat of
the sun&mdash;namely, the afternoon heat. Their furniture is rude, and
they have neither tapestry, nor wainscoted walls, nor any kind of
ornament. Yet they live always in the greatest luxury, eating and
drinking of the best. Some of the houses&mdash;my master's among
them&mdash;have an open verandah (as they call it: in Somersetshire
we should call it a linney) running round three sides of the house,
with coarse canvas curtains which can be let down so as to keep out
the sun, or drawn up to admit the air. But their way of living&mdash;though
they eat and drink of the best&mdash;is rude, even compared
with that of our farmers at home; and a thriving tradesman, say,
of Taunton, would scorn to live in such a house as contenteth a
wealthy planter of Barbadoes. Behind the house is always a
spacious garden, in which grow all kinds of fruits and vegetables,
and all round the buildings on every side stretched the broad fields
of sugar-canes, which, when they are in their flower or blossom of
grey and silver, wave in the wind more beautifully than even a
field of barley in England.</p>

<p>On the approach of our party and hearing the voices of the overseers,
a gentlewoman (so, at least, she seemed) came out of the
house and stood upon the verandah, shading her eyes and looking
at the gang of wretches. She was dressed splendidly in a silken
gown and flowered petticoat, as if she was a very great lady, indeed;
over her head lay a kerchief of rich black lace; round her neck was
a gold chain; when she slowly descended the steps of the verandah
and walked towards us I observed that she was of a darker skin than
it is customary to find at home; it was, indeed, somewhat like the
skin of the gipsy people; her features were straight and regular;
her hair was quite black; her eyes were also black, and large,
shaped like almonds. On her wrists were heavy gold bracelets, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
her fingers were loaded with rings. She seemed about thirty years
of age. She was a woman of tall and fine presence, and she stood
and moved as if she was a queen. She presently came forth from
the verandah and walked across the yard towards us.</p>

<p>'Let me look at them&mdash;your new batch,' she said, speaking
languidly, and with an accent somewhat foreign. 'How many are
there? Where do they come from? Who is this one, for instance?'
She took the girl named Deb by the chin, and looked at her as if
she were some animal to be sold in the market. 'A stout wench,
truly. What was she over there?'</p>

<p>The overseer read the name and the crimes of the prisoner.
Madam (this was the only name by which I knew her) pushed her
away disdainfully.</p>

<p>'Well,' she said, 'she will find companions enough here. I
hope she will work without the whip. Hark ye, girl,' she added
with, I think, kindly intent, 'it goes still to my heart when I hear
that the women have been trounced; but the work must be done.
Remember that! And who are those&mdash;and those?' She pointed
with contempt to the poor creatures covered with dirt and dust,
and in the ragged, miserable clothes they had worn all the voyage.
'Street sweepings; rogues and thieves all. Let them know,' she
said grandly, 'what awaits those who skulk and those who thieve.
And whom have we here?'&mdash;she turned to me&mdash;'Is this some fine
city madam fresh from Bridewell?'</p>

<p>'This prisoner,' said the overseer, 'is described as a rebel in
the late Monmouth rising.'</p>

<p>'A rebel? Truly?' she asked with curiosity. 'Were Monmouth's
soldiers women? We heard by the last ship something of
this. Madam, I know not why you must needs become a rebel;
but this, look you, is no place for gentlewomen to sit down and
fold their arms.'</p>

<p>'Madam,' I replied, 'I look for nothing less than to work,
being now a convict (though I was never tried) and condemned&mdash;I
know not by whom&mdash;to transportation in his Majesty's Plantations.'</p>

<p>'Let me look at your hands,' she said sharply. 'Why, of
what use are these little fingers? They have never done any
work. And your face&mdash;prithee, turn back your hood.' I obeyed,
and her eyes suddenly softened. Indeed, I looked not for this sign
of compassion, and my own tears began to flow. ''Tis a shame!'
she cried. ''Tis a burning shame to send so young a woman&mdash;and
a gentlewoman, and one with such a face&mdash;to the Plantations!
Have they no bowels? Child, who put thee aboard the ship?'</p>

<p>'I was brought on board by one Mr. Penne, who deceived me,
promising that I should be taken to New England, where I have
cousins.'</p>

<p>'We will speak of this presently. Meantime&mdash;since we must
by the law find you some work to do&mdash;can you sew?'</p>

<p>'Yes, Madam, I can perform any kind of needlework, from
plain sewing to embroidery.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span></p>

<p>'What mean they,' she cried again, 'by sending a helpless girl
alone with such a crew? The very Spaniards of whom they talk
so much would blush for such barbarity. Well, they would send
her to a convent where the good Nuns would treat her kindly.
Madam, or Miss, thou art bought, and the master may not, by
law, release you. But there is a way of which we will talk presently.
Meanwhile, thou canst sit in the sewing-room, where we may find
thee work.'</p>

<p>I thanked her. She would have said more; but there came
forth from the house, with staggering step, the man who had
bought us. He had now put off his wig and his scarlet coat, and
wore a white dressing-gown and a linen nightcap. He had in his
hand a whip, which he cracked as he walked.</p>

<p>'Child,' said Madam, quickly, 'pull down your hood. Hide
your face. He hath been drinking, and at such times he is dangerous.
Let him never set eyes upon thee save when he is sober.'</p>

<p>He came rolling and staggering, and yet not so drunk but he
could speak, though his voice was thick.</p>

<p>'Oho!' he cried. 'Here are the new servants. Stand up,
every man and woman. Stand up, I say!' Here he cracked his
whip, and they obeyed, trembling. But Madam placed herself in
front of me. 'Let me look at ye.' He walked along the line,
calling the unhappy creatures vile and foul names. O shame!
thus to mock their misery! 'What!' he cried. 'You think you
have come to a country where there is nothing to do but lie on
your backs and eat turtle and drink mobbie? What! You shall
find out your mistake.' Here he cracked his whip again. 'You
shall work all day in the field, not because you like it, but because
you must. For your food, it shall be loblollie, and for your drink,
water from the pond. What, I say! Those who skulk shall learn
that the Newgate "cat" is tender compared with her brother of
Barbadoes. Tremble, therefore, ye devils all; tremble!'</p>

<p>They trembled visibly. All were now subdued. Those of them
who swaggered&mdash;the dare-devil reckless blades&mdash;when first we
sailed, were now transformed into cowardly, trembling wretches,
all half-starved, and some reduced with fevers, with no more spirit
left than enabled them still to curse and swear. The feeblest of
mortals, the lowest of human wretches, has still left so much
strength and will that he can sink his immortal soul lower still&mdash;a
terrible power, truly!</p>

<p>Then Madam drew me aside gently, and led me to a place like
a barn, where many women, white and black, sat sewing, and a
great quantity of little black babies and naked children played
about under their charge. The white women were sad and silent;
the blacks, I saw with surprise, were all chattering and laughing.
The negro is happy, if he have enough to eat and drink, whether
he be slave or free. Madam sat down upon a bench, and caused me
to sit beside her.</p>

<p>'Tell me,' she said, kindly, 'what this means. When did<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
women begin to rebel? If men are such fools as to go forth and
fight, let them; but for women'&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>'Indeed,' I told her, 'I did not fight.'</p>

<p>Then nothing would do but I must tell her all, from the beginning&mdash;my
name, my family, and my history. But I told her
nothing about my marriage.</p>

<p>'So,' she said, 'you have lost father, mother, brothers, lover,
and friends by this pretty business. And all because they will not
suffer the King to worship in his own way. Well, 'tis hard for
you. To be plain, it may be harder than you think, or I can help.
You have been bought for sixty pounds, and that not for any profit
that your work will bring to the estate, because such as you are but
a loss and a burden; but only in the hope that your friends will
pay a great sum for ransom.'</p>

<p>'Madam, I have indeed no friends left who can do this for me.'</p>

<p>'If so, it is indeed unfortunate. For presently the master will
look for letters on your behalf, and if none come I know not what
he may threaten, or what he may do. But think&mdash;try to find
some one. Consider, your lot here must be hard at best; whereas,
if you are released, you can live where you please; you may even
marry whom you please, because beautiful young gentlewomen like
yourself are scarce indeed in Barbadoes. 'Tis Christian charity to
set you free. Remember, Child, that money will do here what I
suppose it will do anywhere&mdash;all are slaves to money. You have six
months before you in which to write to your friends and to receive
an answer. If in that time nothing comes, I tell thee again, Child,
that I know not what will happen. As for the life in the fields, it
would kill thee in a week.'</p>

<p>'Perhaps, if the Lord so wills,' I replied helplessly, 'that may
be best. Friends have I none now, nor any whom I could ask for
help&mdash;save the Lord alone. I will ask for work in the fields.'</p>

<p>'Perhaps he may forget thee,' she said&mdash;meaning the master.
'But no; a man who hath once seen thy face will never forget
thee. My dear, he told me when he came home that he had
bought a woman whose beauty would set the island in flames.
Pray heaven he come not near thee when he is in liquor. Hide
that face, Child. Hide that face. Let him never see thee. Oh!
there are dangers worse than labour in the fields&mdash;worse than
whip of overseer!' She sprang to her feet, and clasped her hands.
'You talk of the Lord's will! What hath the Lord to do with
this place? Here is nothing but debauchery and drinking, cruelty
and greed. Why have they sent here a woman who prays?'</p>

<p>Then she sat down again and took my hand.</p>

<p>'Tender maid,' she said, 'thy face is exactly such as the face
of a certain saint&mdash;'tis in a picture which hangs in the chapel of
the convent where the good nuns brought me up long ago, before
I came to this place&mdash;long ago. Yes, I forget the name of the
saint; thou hast her face. She stood, in the picture, surrounded
by soldiers who had red hair, and looked like devils&mdash;English<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
devils, the nuns said. Her eyes were raised to heaven, and she
prayed. But what was done unto her I know not, because there
was no other picture. Now she sits upon a throne in the presence
of the Mother of God.'</p>

<p>The tears stood in her great black eyes&mdash;I take it that she was
thinking of the days when she was young.</p>

<p>'Well, we must keep thee out of his way. While he is sober
he listens to reason, and thinks continually upon his estate and his
gains. When he is drunk no one can hold him, and reason is lost
on him.'</p>

<p>She presently brought me a manchet of white bread and a glass
of Madeira wine, and then told me that she would give me the best
cottage that the estate possessed, and, for my better protection,
another woman to share it with me. I thanked her again, and
asked that I might have the girl called Deb, which she readily
granted.</p>

<p>And so my first day of servitude ended in thus happily finding
a protector. As for the cottage, it was a poor thing; but it had a
door, and a window with a shutter. The furniture was a pallet
with two thick rugs, and nothing more. My condition was desperate,
indeed; but yet, had I considered, I had been, so far,
most mercifully protected. I was shipped as a convict (it is true)
by a treacherous villain; but on the ship I found a compassionate
captain, who saved me from the company among whom I must
otherwise have dwelt. I was sold to a drunken and greedy planter;
but I found a compassionate woman who promised to do what she
could; and I had for my companion the woman who had become a
most faithful maid to me upon the voyage, and who still continued
in her fidelity and her love. Greater mercies yet&mdash;and also greater
troubles&mdash;were in store, as you shall see.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXVII.</h2>

<h3>BY THE WATERS OF BABYLON.</h3>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 238px;">
<img src="images/i_278.jpg" width="238" height="350" alt="Thus" />
</div>

<p>Thus delivered from the slavery
of the fields, I began to work,
an unprofitable servant,
among those who made and
mended the garments of the
servants and negroes. On
an estate so large as this there
is always plenty to be done
by the sempstresses and
needlewomen. Thus, to every
woman is given by the year
four smocks, two petticoats,
and four coifs, besides shoes,
which are brought from England
by the ships. Those
who wait in the house have,
in addition, six smocks and
three waistcoats. To the
men are given six shirts; and
to every man and woman a rug or gown of thick
stuff to cast about them when they come home hot,
so that they may not catch cold&mdash;a thing which
throws many into a fever. All these things have
to be made and mended on the estate.</p>

<p>As for the children, the little blacks, they run
about without clothing, their black skin sufficing.
The women who are engaged upon the work of sewing are commonly
those of the white servants, who are not strong enough for
the weeding and hoeing in the fields, or are old and past hard work.
Yet the stuff of which the smocks and shirts are made is so coarse
that it tore the skin from my fingers, which, when Madam saw,
she brought me fine work&mdash;namely, for herself. She was also so
good as to provide me with a change of clothes, of which I stood
sadly in need, and excused my wearing the dress of the other
women. I hope that I am not fond of fine apparel, more than becomes
a modest woman, but I confess that the thought of wearing
this livery of servitude, this coarse and common dress of smock,
petticoat, and coif, all of rough and thick stuff, like canvas, with a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
pair of shoes and no stockings, filled my very soul with dismay.
None of the many acts of kindness shown me by Madam was more
gratefully received than her present of clothes&mdash;not coarse and
rough to the skin, nor ugly and common, befitting prisoners and
criminals, but soft and pleasant to wear, and fit for the heat of the
climate. 'Twas no great hardship, certainly, to rise early and to sit
all day with needle and thread in a great room well-aired. The
company, to be sure, was not what one would have chosen; nor
was the language of the poor creatures who sat with me&mdash;prison
and Bridewell birds, or negro slaves&mdash;such as my poor mother
would have desired her daughter to hear. The food was coarse;
but I was often at the house (when the master was away), and there
Madam would constantly give me something from her own table, a
dish of chocolata (rightly called the Indian nectar) made so thick
and strong that a spoon stands upright in it, or a glass of Madeira,
if my cheeks looked paler than ordinary. In this country, the great
heat of the air seems to suck out and devour the heat of the body,
so that those of European birth, if they are not nourished on
generous diet, presently fall into a decline or wasting away, as is
continually seen in the case of white servants, both men and
women, who die early, and seldom last more than five or six years.</p>

<p>Briefly, Madam seemed to take great pleasure in my conversation,
and would either seek me in the work-room, or would have
me to the house, asking questions as to my former life. For herself,
I learned that she was born in Cuba, and had been brought
up by nuns in a convent; but how or why she came to this place, I
knew not, nor did I ask. Other gentlewomen of the island I never
saw, and I think there were none who visited her. Nor did she
show kindness to the women servants (except to myself), treating
them all, as is the fashion in that country, as if they were so
many black negroes, not condescending to more than a word or a
command; and if this were disobeyed, they knew very well what
to expect from her. But to me she continued throughout to be
kind and gracious, thinking always how she could lighten my lot.</p>

<p>In this employment, therefore, I continued with such contentment
as may be imagined, which was rather a forced resignation to
the will of the Lord than a cheerful heart. But I confess that I
looked upon the lot of the other women with horror, and was
thankful indeed that I was spared the miseries of those who go
forth to the fields. They begin at six in the morning, and work
until eleven, when they come home to dinner: at one o'clock they
go out again and return at sunset, which, in this country, is nearly
always about half-past six. But let no one think that work in
the fields at Barbadoes may be compared with work in the fields at
home; for in England there are cloudy skies and cold wintry days
in plenty, but in Barbadoes, save when the rain falls in prodigious
quantities, the skies have no clouds, but are clear blue all the year
round: the sun burns with a heat intolerable, so that the eyes are
well-nigh blinded, the head aches, the limbs fail, and, but for fear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
of the lash, the wretched toiler would lie down in the nearest
shade. And a terrible thirst (all this was told me by the girl Deb)
seizes the throat, all day long, which nothing can assuage but rest.
For the least skulking the whip is laid on; and if there be a word
of impatience or murmuring, it is called stark mutiny, for which
the miserable convict, man or woman, is tied up and flogged with a
barbarity which would be incredible to any were it not for the
memory of certain floggings in our own country. Besides the lash,
they have also the pillory and the stocks, and the overseers carry
in addition to their whip a heavy cane, with which they constantly
belabour the slaves, both white and black. I say 'slaves' because
the white servants are nothing less, save that the negroes are far
better off, and receive infinitely better treatment than the poor
white creatures. Indeed, the negro being the absolute property of
his master, both he and his children, to ill-treat him is like the
wanton destruction of cattle on a farm; whereas there is no reason
in making the convicts last out more than the ten years of their
servitude, or even so long, because many of them are such poor
creatures when they arrive, and so reduced by the miseries of the
voyage, and so exhausted by the hard labour to which they are
put, that they bring no profit to the master, but quickly fall ill and
die like rotten sheep. Like rotten sheep, I say, they die, without
a word of Christian exhortation; and like brute creatures, who
have no world to come, are they buried in the ground! Again, the
food served out to these poor people is not such as should be given
to white people in a hot climate. There is nothing but water to
drink, and that drawn from ponds, because in Barbadoes there are
few springs or rivers. It is true that the old hands, who have
learned how to manage, contrive to make plantain wine, and get,
by hook or by crook, mobbie (which is a strong drink made from
potatoes), or kill-devil, which is the new spirit distilled from sugar.
Then for solid food, the servants are allowed five pounds of salt
beef for each person every week, and this so hard and stringy that
no boiling will make it soft enough for the teeth. Sometimes,
instead of the beef, they have as much salt fish, for the most part
stinking; with this a portion of ground Indian corn, which is made
into a kind of porridge, and called loblollie. This is the staple of
the food, and there are no rustics at home who do not live better
and have more nourishing food.</p>

<p>I do not deny that the convicts are for the most part a horrid
crew, who deserve to suffer if any men ever did; but it was sad to
see how the faces of the people were pinched with hunger and
wasted with the daily fatigues, and how their hollow eyes were full
of despair. Whatever their sins may have been, they were at least
made in God's own image: no criminal, however wicked, should
have been used with such barbarity as was wreaked upon the people
of this estate. The overseers were chosen (being themselves also
convicts) for their hardness of heart. Nay, did they show the
least kindness towards the poor creatures whom they drove, they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
would themselves be forced to lay down the whip of office and to
join the gang of those who toiled. And over them was the master,
jealous to exact the last ounce of strength from the creatures whom
he had bought. Did the good people of Bristol who buy the sugar
and molasses and tobacco of the Indies know or understand the
tears of despair and the sweat of agony which are forced with every
pound of sugar, they would abhor the trade which makes them
rich.</p>

<p>The companion of my sleeping-hut, the girl Deb, was a great,
strapping wench, who bid fair to outlast her ten years of servitude,
even under the treatment to which, with the rest, she was daily
subjected. And partly because she was strong and active, partly
because she had a certain kind of beauty (the kind which belongs
to the rustic, and is accompanied by good-humour and laughter),
she would perhaps have done well, as some of the women do, and
ended by marrying an overseer, but for events which presently
happened. Yet, strong as she was, there was no evening when she
did not return worn out with fatigue, her cheeks burning, her
limbs weary, yet happy because she had one more day escaped the
lash, and had the night before her in which to rest. If it is worth
noting, the women were from the outset the most willing workers,
and the most eager to satisfy their taskmasters; the men, on the
other hand, went sullen and downcast, thinking only how to escape
the overseer's whip, and going through the work with angry and
revengeful eyes. I think that some great mutiny might have happened
upon this estate&mdash;some wild revenge&mdash;so desperate were
these poor creatures and so horrible were the scourgings they endured,
and the shrieks and curses which they uttered. Let me not
speak of these things.</p>

<p>There are other things which make residence in Barbadoes,
even to the wealthy, full of annoyances and irritations. The place
is filled with cockroaches, great spiders, horrid scorpions, centipedes,
and lizards. There are ants which swarm everywhere, and
there are clouds of flies, and at night there are moskeetos and
merrywings, which by their bites have been known to drive new-comers
into fever, or else into a kind of madness.</p>

<p>In the evenings after supper there reigned a melancholy silence
in the village, the people for the most part taking rest with weary
limbs. Sometimes there would be a quarrel, with horrid oaths and
curses and perhaps some fighting; but these occasions were rare.</p>

<p>From the house there came often the noise of singing, drinking,
and loud talking when other planters would ride over for a
drinking bout. There was also sometimes to be heard the music
of the theorbo, upon which Madam played very sweetly, singing
Spanish songs; so that it seemed a pity for music so sweet to
be thrown away upon this selfish crew. It made me think of
Humphrey, and of the sweet and holy thoughts which he would
put into rhymes, and then fit the rhymes with music which seemed
to breathe those very thoughts. Alas! In the village of Bradford<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
Orcas there would be now silence and desolation! The good old
Squire dead, my father dead, the young men sent to the Plantations,
no one left at all but the Rector and Madam his sister-in-law,
and I, alas! a slave. Perchance at that moment the Rector might
be slowly drawing his bow across the strings of his violoncello
thinking of those who formerly played with him; or perhaps he
would be sorrowfully taking out his cases and gazing for a little
consolation upon the figures of his goddesses and his nymphs.
Only to think of the place, and of those who once lived there,
tore my poor heart to pieces.</p>

<p>One evening, when there was a great noise and talking at the
house, while we were sitting upon our beds with no other light
than that of the moon, Madam herself came to the cottage.</p>

<p>'Child,' she said, 'nothing will do but that the gentlemen
must see thy beauty. Nay, no harm shall happen while I am
there: so much they know. But he hath so bragged about thy
beauty and the great price he will demand for ransom that the
rest are mad to see thee. I swear that not the least rudeness shall
be offered thee. They are drinking, it is true; but they are not
yet drunk. Come!'</p>

<p>So I arose and followed her. First, she took me to her own
room, where she took off my hood and threw over me a long white
lace mantilla, which covered my head and fell over my shoulders
and below the waist.</p>

<p>She sighed as she looked at me.</p>

<p>'Poor innocent!' she said. 'If money could buy that face,
there is not a man in the room but would give all he hath and
count it gain. Canst thou play or sing?'</p>

<p>I told her that I had some knowledge of the theorbo. Therefore
she brought me hers, and bade me sing to the gentlemen and
then retire quickly. So I followed her into the living or keeping
room, where a dozen gentlemen were sitting round the table. A
bowl of punch was on the table, and every man had his glass
before him, and a pipe of tobacco in his hand. Some of their
faces were flushed with wine.</p>

<p>'Gentlemen,' said Madam, 'our prisoner hath consented to
sing one song to you, after which she will ask permission to bid
you good-night.'</p>

<p>So they all clapped their hands and rapped the table, and I,
being indeed terrified, but knowing very well that to show fear
would be the worst thing I could do, touched the strings and began
my song. I sang the song which Humphrey made, and which he
sang to the officers at Taunton when the Duke was there.</p>

<p>When I finished, I gave back the theorbo to Madam, curtsied
to the gentlemen, and quickly stepped back to Madam's room,
while they all bellowed and applauded and roared for me to come
back again. But I put on my hood and slipped out to the cottage,
where I lay down beside Deb, and quickly fell asleep. (It is a
great happiness, in these hot latitudes, that, when a new-comer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
hath once got over the trouble of the merrywings, he falleth asleep
the moment he lies down, and so sleeps through the whole night.)</p>

<p>But in the morning Madam came to see me while I was sewing.</p>

<p>'Well, Child,' she said, laughing, 'thou hast gotten a lover who
swears that he will soon have thee out of this hell.'</p>

<p>'A lover!' I cried. 'Nay!&mdash;that may God forbid!'</p>

<p>''Tis true. Young Mr. Anstiss it is. While thou wast singing
he gazed on thy pretty face and listened as one enchanted. I
wonder&mdash;but no!&mdash;thou hast no eyes for such things. And when
thou wast gone he offered the master four times the sum he paid
for thee&mdash;yea, four times&mdash;or six times&mdash;saying that he meant
honourably, and that if any man dared to whisper anything to the
contrary he would cut his throat.'</p>

<p>'Alas! Madam. I must never marry&mdash;either this Mr. Anstiss
or any other.'</p>

<p>'Tut&mdash;tut. This is foolish maid's nonsense. Granted you
have lost your old lover, there are plenty more. Suppose he hath
lost his old sweetheart, there are plenty more&mdash;as I doubt not he
hath already proved. Mr. Anstiss is a very pretty young gentleman;
but the master would not listen, saying that he waited for
the lady's friends.'</p>

<p>And so passed six weeks, or thereabouts, for the only count of
time I kept was from Sunday to Sunday. On that day we rested;
the negroes, who are no better than heathens, danced. The white
servants lay about in the shade, and drank what they could; in
one cottage only on that godless estate were prayers offered.</p>

<p>And then happened that great event which, in the end, proved
to be a change in my whole life, and brought happiness out of
misery, and joy out of suffering, though at first it seemed only a
dreadful addition to my trouble. Thus is the course of things
ordered for us, and thus the greatest blessings follow upon the
most threatening juncture. What this was I will tell in a few
words.</p>

<p>It was about the third week in September when I embarked,
and about the third week in November when the ship made her
port. Therefore, I take it that it was one day about the beginning
of the year 1686, when Madam came to the work-room and told me
that a ship had arrived carrying a cargo of two hundred rebels and
more, sent out to work upon the Plantations, like myself, for
the term of ten years. She also told me that the master was gone
to the Bridge in order to buy some of them. Not, she said, that
he wanted more hands; but he expected that there would be among
them persons of quality, who would be glad to buy their freedom.
He still, she told me, looked to make a great profit out of myself,
and was thinking to sell me, unless my friends in England speedily
sent proposals for my ransom, to the young planter who was in
love with me. This did not displease me. I have not thought it
necessary to tell how Mr. Anstiss came often to the estate, and
continually devised schemes for looking at me, going to the Ingenio,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
whence he could see those who sat in the work-room, and
even sending me letters, vowing the greatest extravagance of passion&mdash;I
say I was not displeased, because there was in this young
gentleman's face a certain goodness of disposition clearly marked;
so that even if I became his property I thought I might persuade
him to relinquish thoughts of love, even if I had to trust myself
entirely to his honour and tell him all. But, as you shall hear,
this project of the master's was brought to naught.</p>

<p>As for the rebels, I was curious to see them. Some I might
recognise; to some I might perhaps be of a little use at the outset
in guarding them against dangers. I did not fear, or think it likely,
that there would be any among them whom I might know or who
might know me. Yet the thing which I least suspected, and the
least feared&mdash;a thing which one would have thought so unlikely as
to make the event a miracle&mdash;nay, call it rather the merciful ordering
of all&mdash;that thing, I say, actually happened.</p>

<p>The newly-bought servants arrived at about five in the evening.</p>

<p>I looked out of the work-room to see them. Why, I seemed to
know their faces&mdash;all their faces! They were our brave West
Country lads, whom I had last seen marching gallantly out of
Taunton town to victory and glory (as they believed). Now&mdash;pale
with the miseries of the voyage, thin with bad food and disease,
hollow-cheeked and hollow-eyed, in rags and dirt, barefooted,
covered with dust, grimy for want of washing, their beards grown
all over their faces&mdash;with hanging heads, stood these poor fellows.
There were thirty of them; some had thrown themselves on the
ground, as if in the last extremity of fatigue; some stood with the
patience that one sees in brute beasts who are waiting to be killed; and
in a group together stood three&mdash;oh! merciful Heaven! was this misery
also added to my cup!&mdash;they were Robin, Barnaby, and Humphrey!
Robin's face, heavy and pale, betrayed the sorrow of his soul. He
stood as one who neither careth for nor regardeth anything. My
heart fell like lead to witness the despair which was visible in his
attitude, in his eyes, in his brow. But Barnaby showed still a
cheerful countenance and looked about him, as if he was arriving a
welcome guest instead of a slave.</p>

<p>'Do you know any of them, Child?' Madam asked.</p>

<p>'Oh! Madam,' I cried; 'they are my friends&mdash;they are my
friends. Oh! help them&mdash;help them!'</p>

<p>'How can I help them?' she replied coldly. 'They are rebels,
and they are justly punished. Let them write home for money if
they have friends, and so they can be ransomed. To make them
write the more movingly, the master hath resolved to send them all
to work in the fields. "The harder they work," he says, "the
more they will desire to be free again."'</p>

<p>In the fields! Oh! Robin&mdash;my poor Robin!</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXVIII.</h2>

<h3>HUMPHREY'S NARRATIVE.</h3>


<div class="drop">
<img src="images/i_285.jpg" alt="W" width="100" height="101" class="cap" />
 <p class="cap_1">With these words&mdash;'Oh! Robin! Robin!'&mdash;the history, as
set down in my Mistress's handwriting, suddenly comes
to an end. The words are fitting, because her whole
heart was full of Robin, and though at this time it
seemed to the poor creature a sin still to nourish affection
for her old sweetheart, I am sure&mdash;nay, I have it on her own confession&mdash;that
there was never an hour in the waking day when Robin
was not in her mind, though between herself and her former lover
stood the dreadful figure of her husband. I suppose that, although she
began this work with the design to complete it, she had not the courage,
even when years had passed away and much earthly happiness had
been her reward, to write down the passages which follow. Wherefore
(and for another reason&mdash;namely, a confession which must be
made by myself before I die) I have taken upon myself to finish
that part of Alice Eykin's history which relates to the Monmouth
rising and its unhappy consequences. You have read how (thanks
to my inexperience and ignorance of conspiracies, and belief in men's
promises) we were reduced to the lowest point of disgrace and
poverty. Alice did not tell, because till afterwards she did not
know, that on Sir Christopher's death his estate was declared confiscated,
and presently bestowed upon Benjamin by favour of Lord
Jeffreys; so that he whose ambition it was to become Lord Chancellor
was already (which he had not expected) the Lord of the Manor of
Bradford Orcas. But of this hereafter.</p>
</div>

<p>I have called her my Mistress. Truly, all my life she hath been
to me more than was ever Laura to Petrarch, or even Beatrice to
the great Florentine. The ancients represented every virtue by a
Goddess, a Grace, or a Nymph. Nay, the Arts were also feminine
(yet subject to the informing influence of the other sex, as the
Muses had Apollo for their director and chief). To my mind every
generous sentiment, every worthy thought, all things that are
gracious, all things that lift my soul above the common herd,
belong not to me, but to my Mistress. In my youth it was she
who encouraged me to the practice of those arts by which the soul
is borne heavenwards&mdash;I mean the arts of poetry and of music: it
was she who listened patiently when I would still be prating of
myself, and encouraged the ambitions which had already seized my
soul. So that if I turned a set of verses smoothly, it was to Alice<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
that I gave them, and for her that I wrote them. When we played
heavenly music together, the thoughts inspired by the strain were
like the Italian painter's vision of the angels which attend the
Virgin&mdash;I mean that, sweet and holy as the angels are, they fall
far short of the holiness and sweetness of her whom they honour.
So, whatever my thoughts or my ambitions, amidst them all I saw
continually the face of Alice, always filled with candour and with
sweetness. That quality which enables a woman to think always
about others, and never about herself, was given to Alice in large
and plenteous measure. If she talked with me, her soul was all
mine. If she was waiting on Madam, or upon Sir Christopher, or
upon the Rector, or on her own mother, she knew their inmost
thoughts and divined all their wants. Nay, long afterwards, in the
daily exercise of work and study, at the University of Oxford, in
the foreign schools of Montpellier, Padua, and Leyden, it was Alice
who, though far away, encouraged me. I could no longer hear her
voice; but her steadfast eyes remained in my mind like twin stars
that dwell in heaven. This is a wondrous power given to a few
women, that they should become as it were angels sent from heaven,
lent to the earth a while, in order to fill men's minds with worthy
thoughts, and to lead them in the heavenly way. The Romish
Church holds that the age of miracles hath never passed; which I
do also believe, but not in the sense taught by that Church. Saints
there are among us still, who daily work miracles, turning earthly
clay into the jasper and the precious marble of heaven!</p>

<p>Again, the great poet Milton hath represented his virtuous lady
unharmed among the rabble rout of Comus, protected by her virtue
alone. Pity that he hath not also shown a young man led by that
sweet lady, encouraged, warned, and guarded along that narrow
way, beset with quag and pitfall, along which he must walk who
would willingly climb to higher place! And all this apart from
earthly love, as in the case of those two Italian poets.</p>

<p>More, I confess, I would have had, and presumptuously longed
for it&mdash;nay, even prayed for it with such yearnings and longings as
seemed to tear my very heart asunder. But this was denied to me.</p>

<p>In September, 1685, ten weeks after the fight of Sedgemoor, we,
being by that time well tired of Exeter Prison, were tried by Lord
Jeffreys. It was no true trial, for we were all advised to plead
guilty, upon which the Judge bellowed and roared at us, abusing
us in such language as I never thought to hear from the bench, and
finally sentenced us all to death. (A great deal has been said of
this roaring of the Judge, but I am willing to excuse it in great
measure, on the ground of the disease from which he was then
suffering. I myself, who had heard that he was thus afflicted, saw
the drops of agony upon his forehead, and knew that if he was not
bawling at us he must have been roaring on his own account.) So
we were marched back to prison and began to prepare for the last
ceremony, which is, I think, needlessly horrible and barbarous. To
cut a man open while he is still living is a thing not practised even<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
by the savage Turk. At this gloomy time my cousin Robin set a
noble example of fortitude, which greatly encouraged the rest of us.
Nor would he ever suffer me to reproach myself (as I was continually
tempted to do) with having been the cause of the ruin which had
fallen upon the whole of our unfortunate house. Nay, he went
further, and insisted, and would have it, that had I remained in
Holland he himself would have joined the Duke, and that I was in
no way to blame as an inciter to this unfortunate act. We knew
by this time that Sir Christopher had been arrested and conveyed
to Ilminster Jail, and that with him were Dr. Eykin, grievously
wounded, and Barnaby; and that Alice, with her mother, was also
at Ilminster. Mr. Boscorel, for his part, was gone to London in
order to exert whatever interest he might possess on behalf of all.
With him went Madam, Robin's mother; but she returned before
the trial, much dejected, so that we were not encouraged to hope
for anything from that quarter. Madam began to build some hopes
at this time from Benjamin, because he, who had accompanied the
Judges from London, was the boon companion every night of Lord
Jeffreys himself. But it is one thing to be permitted to drink and
sing with a great man at night, and another thing to procure of
him the pardon of rebels (and those not the common sort, but
leaders and captains). That Benjamin would attempt to save us,
I did not doubt; because in common decency and humanity he
must needs try to save his grandfather and his cousins. But that
he would effect anything&mdash;that, indeed, I doubted. Whether he
did make an attempt, I know not. He came not to the prison, nor
did he make any sign that he knew we were among the prisoners.
What he contrived, the plot which he laid, and the villainy with
which he carried it out, you have already read. Well, I shall have
much more to say about Benjamin. For the moment, let him pass.</p>

<p>I say, then, that we were lying in Exeter Jail, expecting to be
called out for execution at any hour. We were sitting in the courtyard
on the stone bench with gloomy hearts.</p>

<p>'Robin&mdash;Humphrey&mdash;lads both!' cried a voice we knew. It
was the Rector, Mr. Boscorel himself, who called us. 'Courage,
lads!' he cried (yet looked himself as mournful as man can look).
'I bring you good news&mdash;I have this day ridden from Ilminster
(there is other news not so good)&mdash;good news, I say: for you shall
live, and not die! I have so far succeeded that the lives are spared
of Robin Challis, Captain in the Rebel Cavalry; Barnaby Eykin,
Captain of the Green Regiment; and Humphrey Challis, Chyrurgeon
to the Duke. Yet must you go to the Plantations&mdash;poor lads!&mdash;there
to stay for ten long years. Well, we will hope to get your pardon
and freedom long before that time is over. Yet you must, perforce,
sail across the seas.'</p>

<p>'Lad,' cried Robin, catching my hand, 'cease to tear thy heart
with reproaches! See! none of us will die, after all.'</p>

<p>'On the scaffold, none,' said Mr. Boscorel. 'On the scaffold,
none,' he repeated.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span></p>

<p>'And what saith my grandfather, Sir?' Robin asked. 'He is
also enlarged, I hope, at least. And how is the learned Dr. Eykin?
and Alice&mdash;my Alice&mdash;where is she?'</p>

<p>'Young men,' said the Rector, 'prepare for tidings of the
worst&mdash;yes; of the very worst. Cruel news I bring to you, boys;
and for myself'&mdash;he hung his head&mdash;'cruel news, shameful news?'</p>

<p>Alas! you know already what he had to tell us. Worse than
the death of that good old man, Sir Christopher; worse than the
death of the unfortunate Dr. Eykin and his much-tried wife; there
was the news of Alice's marriage and of her flight, and at hearing
this we looked at each other in dismay, and Robin sprang to his
feet and cried aloud for vengeance upon the villain who had done
this thing.</p>

<p>'It is my own son,' said Mr. Boscorel; 'yet spare him not!
He deserves all that you can call him, and more. Shameful news
I had to tell you. Where the poor child hath found a retreat or
how she fares, I know not. Robin, ask me not to curse my own
son&mdash;what is done will bring its punishment in due time. Doubt
it not. But of punishment we need not speak. If there were any
way&mdash;any way possible&mdash;out of it! But there is none. It is a
fatal blow. Death itself alone can release her. Consider, Humphrey,
consider; you are not so distracted as your cousin. Consider,
I say, that unhappy girl is Benjamin's lawful wife. If he
can find her, he may compel her to live with him. She is his
lawful wife, I say. It is a case in which there is no remedy; it is
a wickedness for which there is no help, until one of the twain
shall die.'</p>

<p>There was indeed no help or remedy possible. I will not tell
of the madness which fell upon Robin at this news, nor of the distracted
things he said, nor how he wept for Alice at one moment
and the next cursed the author of this wickedness. There was no
remedy. Yet Mr. Boscorel solemnly promised to seek out the
poor innocent girl, forced to break her vows for the one reason
which could excuse her&mdash;namely, to save the lives of all she loved.</p>

<p>'They were saved already,' Mr. Boscorel added. 'He knew
that they were saved. He had seen me; he had the news that I
brought from London; he knew it; and he lied unto her! There
is no single particular in which his wickedness can be excused or
defended. Yet, I say, curses are of no avail. The Hand of God
is heavy upon all sinners, and will presently fall upon my unhappy
son&mdash;I pray that before that Hand shall fall his heart may be
touched with repentance.'</p>

<p>But Robin fell into a melancholy from which it was impossible
to arouse him. He who, while death upon the scaffold seemed certain,
was cheerful and brave, now, when his life was spared, sat
heavy and gloomy, speaking to no one; or, if he spoke, then in
words of rage and impatience.</p>

<p>Mr. Boscorel remained at Exeter, visiting us daily until the
time came when we were removed. He brought with him one day<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
a smooth-tongued gentleman in sober attire, who was, he told us, a
West Indian merchant of Bristol, named George Penne. (You
have read, and know already, how great a villain was this man.)</p>

<p>'This gentleman,' said Mr. Boscorel, 'is able and willing, for
certain considerations, to assist you in your exile. You have been
given (among many others) by the King to one Mr. Jerome Nipho,
who hath sold all his convicts to this gentleman. In his turn, he
is under bonds to ship you for the Plantations, where you will be
sold again to the planters.'</p>

<p>'Sirs,' Mr. Penne looked from one to the other of us with compassionate
eyes, 'I have heard your melancholy case, and it will be
to my great happiness if I may be able in any way to soften the
rigours of your exile. Be it known to you that I have correspondents
in Jamaica, Barbadoes, and Virginia, and that for certain
sums of money these&mdash;my friends&mdash;will readily undertake to make
your servitude one merely in name. In other words, as I have
already informed his Reverence, I have bought you in the hope of
being useful to you (I wish I could thus buy all unhappy prisoners),
and I can, on paying my friends what they demand, secure to you
freedom from labour, subject only to the condition of remaining
abroad until your term is expired, or your friends at home have
procured your pardon.'</p>

<p>'As for the price, Humphrey,' said Mr. Boscorel, 'that shall be
my care. It is nearly certain that Sir Christopher's estates will be
confiscated, seeing that he died in prison under the charge of high
treason, though he was never tried. Therefore we must not look
to his lands for any help. What this gentleman proposes is, however,
so great a thing that we must not hesitate to accept his offer
gratefully.'</p>

<p>'I must have,' said Mr. Penne, 'seventy pounds for each prisoner.
I hear that there is a third young gentleman of your party
now in the same trouble at Ilminster; I shall therefore ask for two
hundred guineas&mdash;two hundred guineas in all. It is not a large
sum in order to secure freedom. Those who cannot obtain this
relief have to work in the fields or in the mills under the hot sun
of the Spanish Main; they are subject to the whip of the overseer;
they have wretched food; they are worse treated than the negroes,
because the latter are slaves for life and the former for ten years
only. By paying two hundred guineas only you will all be enabled
to live at your ease. Meanwhile, your friends at home will be
constantly endeavouring to procure your pardon. I myself, though
but a simple merchant of Bristol City, can boast some influence,
which I will most readily exert to the utmost in your behalf'&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>'Say no more, Sir,' said Mr. Boscorel, interrupting him; 'the
bargain is concluded. These young gentlemen shall not be subjected
to any servitude; I will pay you two hundred guineas.'</p>

<p>'I would, Sir'&mdash;Mr. Penne laid his hand, which was large,
white, and soft, the hand of a liar and a traitor, upon his treacherous
heart&mdash;'I would to Heaven, Sir,' he said, 'that I could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
undertake this service for less. If my correspondents were men of
tender hearts, the business should cost you nothing at all. But
they are men of business; they say that they live not abroad for
pleasure, but for profit; they cannot forego any advantage that
may offer. As for me, this job brings me no profit. Upon my
honour, gentlemen, profit from such a source I should despise:
every guinea that you give me will be placed to the credit of my
correspondents, who will, I am assured, turn a pretty penny by
the ransom of the prisoners. But that we cannot help. And as
for me&mdash;I say it boldly in the presence of this learned and pious
clergyman&mdash;I am richly rewarded with the satisfaction of doing a
generous thing. That is enough, I hope, for any honest man.'</p>

<p>The fellow looked so benevolent, and smiled with so much compassion,
that it was impossible to doubt his word. Besides, Mr.
Boscorel had learned many things during the journey to London;
among others that it would be possible to buy immunity from labour
for the convicts. Therefore, he hesitated not, but gave him what
he demanded, taking in return a paper, which was to be shown to
Mr. Penne's correspondents, in which he acknowledged the receipt
of the money, and demanded in return a release from actual servitude.
This paper I put carefully in my pocket, with my note-book
and my case of instruments.</p>

<p>It was, so far as my memory serves me, about six weeks after
our pardon was received when we heard that we were to be marched
to Bristol, there to be shipped for some port or other across the
ocean. At Taunton we were joined by a hundred poor fellows
as fortunate as ourselves; and at Bridgwater by twenty more, whose
lives had been bought by Colonel Kirke. Fortunate we esteemed
ourselves; for everywhere the roads were lined with legs, heads,
trunks, and arms, boiled and blackened in pitch, stuck up for the
terror of the country. Well; you shall judge how fortunate we
were.</p>

<p>When we reached Bristol, we found Mr. Penne upon the Quay,
with some other merchants. He changed colour when he saw us;
but quickly ran to meet us, and whispered that we were on no
account to betray his goodness in the matter of ransom, otherwise
it might be the undoing of us all, and perhaps cause his own imprisonment.
He also told me that the ship was bound for Barbadoes,
and we should have to mess with the other prisoners on the
voyage, but that it would all be made up to us when we arrived.
He further added that he had requested his correspondents to
entertain us until money should arrive from England, and to
become our bankers for all that we should want. And with that
he clasped my hand tenderly, and with a 'God be wi' ye!' he left
us, and we saw him no more.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXIX.</h2>

<h3>FOR TEN YEARS.</h3>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 238px;">
<img src="images/i_291.jpg" width="238" height="350" alt="It" />
</div>

<p>It was a numerous company
gathered together on the
deck of the ship. By their
dress they were country
lads; by their pale cheeks
they were prison birds like
ourselves; by their dismal
faces they were, also, like
ourselves, rebels condemned
to the Plantations. Alas!
how many of these poor fellows
have returned to their
homes, and how many lie in
the graves of Jamaica, Virginia,
and Barbadoes? As
for preparations for a voyage,
not one of us could make
any, either of clothes or of
provisions. There was not among
the whole company so much as a
change of clothes; nay, there was
not even a razor, and our faces were
already bristling horribly with the
beards which before long made us look like so
many Heyducs.</p>

<p>Among them I presently discerned, to my
great surprise and joy, none other than Barnaby. His coat of
scarlet was now so ragged and stained that neither colour nor
original shape could be discerned, his ruffles and cravat of lace were
gone, and the scarlet sash which had formerly carried his hanger
was gone also. In a word, he was in rags and covered with the
dust of the road. Yet his jolly countenance showed a satisfaction
which contrasted greatly with the dejection of his companions.
He sniffed the scent of tar and ropes with a joy which was visible
to all, and he contemplated the ship and her rigging with the air
of one who is at home.</p>

<p>Then he saw us and shouted to us while he made his way
roughly through the rest.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span></p>

<p>'What cheer, ho! Humphrey, brave lad of boluses?'&mdash;never
did any man grasp the hand of friend with greater vigour. 'This
is better, I say, than the accursed prison, where one got never a
breath of fresh air. Here one begins to smell salt water and tarred
rope, which is a downright wholesome smell. Already I feel
hearty again. I would willingly drink a tankard or two of black
beer. What, Robin, what? We are not going to be hanged, after
all. Lift up thy head, therefore: is this a time for looking glum?
We shall live to hang Judge Jeffreys yet!&mdash;what? Thy looks are
but poorly, lad. Is it the prison or is it thy disappointment?
That villain, Benjamin! Hark ye, Robin'&mdash;some men's faces look
black when they threaten, but Barnaby's grew broader, as if the
contemplation of revenge made him the happier&mdash;'Hark ye, this is
my business. No one shall interfere with me in this. Benjamin
is my affair. No one but I myself must kill Benjamin: not you,
Humphrey, because he is your cousin; not you, Robin, because
you must not kill Alice's husband even to get back your own sweetheart.'
Barnaby spoke wisdom here; in spite of Robin's vows he
could not get Alice for himself by killing her husband, unworthy
though he was. 'Benjamin,' he went on, 'may call her wife, but
if he seek to make her his wife, if I know Sis aright, he will meet
his match. As for her safety, I am certain that she is safe. For
why? Wherever there are folks of her religious kidney, there will
she find friends. Cheer up, Robin! Soon or late I will kill this
fine husband of hers.'</p>

<p>But Robin shook his head.</p>

<p>Barnaby then asked if I knew whither we were bound. I told
him Barbadoes, according to the information given me by Mr. Penne.</p>

<p>'Why,' said Barnaby, rubbing his hands, 'this is brave news,
indeed. There is no place I would sooner choose. 'Tis a small
island, to begin with: give me a small island, so that the sea runneth
all round about and is everywhere within easy reach. Where
there is the sea there are boats; where there are boats there are
the means of escape. Cheer up, my lads! I know the Spanish
Main right well. Give me a tight boat, I care not how small, and
a keg of water, and I will sail her anywhere. Ha! we are bound
to Barbadoes, are we? This is truly brave news!'</p>

<p>I asked him next what kind of place it was.</p>

<p>'It is a hot place,' he replied. 'A man is always thirsty, and
there is plenty to drink except water, which is said to be scarce.
But the merchants and the planters want none. They have wine
of the best, of Spain and of France and of Madeira. Cider and
strong ale they import from England. And drinks they make in
the country&mdash;perino and mobbie&mdash;I remember&mdash;grippo and plantain
wine and kill-devil. 'Tis a rare country for drink, and many
there be who die of too much. Hold up thy head, Robin; we will
drink damnation to Benjamin yet. But 'tis I who shall kill him.
Courage, I say. What? Our turn will come!'</p>

<p>I told him, then, what had been done with Mr. George Penne&mdash;namely,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
the ransom bought by the Rector for us all, and the
letter which I carried to Mr. Penne's correspondent.</p>

<p>'Why,' he said, with some discontent, 'we shall not be long
upon the island after all, and perhaps the money might have been
better bestowed. But 'twas kindly done of the Rector. As for
the banishment, I value it not a farthing. One place is as good as
another; and, for my own part, I love the West Indies. We shall
have our choice among them all, because, where there are
boats and the open sea, a man can go whithersoever pleaseth him
best. The voyage out'&mdash;he glanced round him&mdash;'will, I fear, be
choking work&mdash;the rations will be short, there will be neither drink
nor tobacco, and at nights we shall lie close. A more melancholy
company I never saw. Patience, my lads; our turn will come.'</p>

<p>Well, 'twas a special mercy that we had with us one man, at
least, who preserved his cheerfulness, for the rest of the company
were as melancholy as King James himself could have desired.
Indeed, to look back upon the voyage is to recall the most miserable
time that can be imagined. First of all, as I have said, we were
wholly unprepared for a voyage, having nothing at all with us.
Then we had bad weather at the outset, which not only made our
people ill, but caused the biscuit to be mostly spoiled, so that before
the end of the voyage a few peas with the sweepings of the
biscuit-room, and sometimes a little tough beef, was all our diet,
and for drink nothing, not so much as a pannikin of beer, but
water, and that turbid, and not too much of it.</p>

<p>As for me, I kept my health chiefly by the method common among
physicians&mdash;namely, by watching the symptoms of others. But
mostly was I concerned with the condition of Robin. For the
poor lad, taking so much to heart the dreadful villainy which had
been practised upon Alice, never once held up his head, and would
talk and think of nothing else but of that poor maid.</p>

<p>'Where is she?' he asked a hundred times. 'Where hath she
found a shelter and a hiding-place? How shall she escape the
villain, who will now do what he pleases since we are out of his
way? And no help for her&mdash;not any until she die, or until he
dies! And we cannot even send her a letter to console her poor
heart! Humphrey, it drives me mad to think that every day
carries us further from her. If I could but be with her to protect
her against her husband! Humphrey, Barnaby said well: I could
not get her back to me over the dead body of her husband. But
to protect her&mdash;to stand between her and the man she hath sworn
to obey!'</p>

<p>There is no more dangerous condition of the mind than that
which we call despair. It is, I take it, a disease, and that of the
most dangerous kind. I have observed many men in that condition.
With some, the devil enters into them, finding all the doors
open and unguarded; nay, he even receives a warm welcome.
With others it is as if the body itself was left without its armour&mdash;a
cheerful and hopeful mind being certainly an armour against<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
disease, capable of warding off many of those invisible arrows
which are always flying about the air and striking us down
with fevers, agues, calentures, and other pains and grievous
diseases.</p>

<p>I marvel that more of the men on board were not sick; for, to
begin with, the water soon became thick and swarmed with wriggling
creatures difficult to avoid in drinking; and then, though
during the day we were allowed to be on deck (where the air
was fresh even if the sun was hot), at night we were terribly
crowded below, and lay too close for health or for comfort. However,
we finally made Carlisle Bay and the port of St. Michael's or
the Bridge. And I must say this for Barnaby, that he maintained
throughout the whole voyage his cheerfulness, and that he never
ceased to make his plans for escape, drawing on a paper, which he
procured, a rough chart of the Spanish Main, with as many islands
as he could remember. Of these there are hundreds, some desolate
and safe for fugitives, some with neither water nor green trees,
and some with springs and woods, wild fruit, land turtles on the
shore, fish in the sea, and everything that man can desire.</p>

<p>We made the land, after I know not how many weeks, one day
in the forenoon.</p>

<p>'Barbadoes,' said Barnaby, pointing to a little cloud far away
on the horizon. 'Well; of this job I am wellnigh sick. To-morrow,
if the wind holds, we shall have sailed round the island
and shall beat up for Carlisle Bay. Well, it is lucky for us that
we have this letter of Mr. Penne's. We will go&mdash;I know the
place well&mdash;to the sign of the Rock and Turtle, kept by old
Mother Rosemary, if she lives still, or, if she be dead, by one of
her daughters&mdash;she had fifty daughters, at least, all buxom
mulatto girls. There we will put off these filthy rags, have a
wash in a tub of fresh water, get shaved, and then with smooth
chins and clean shirts we will sit down to a dinner such as the old
woman knows how to make, a potato-pudding and Scots collops
with Rhenish wine, and afterwards a cool cup of beverage, which
is nothing in the world but squeezed limes, with sugar and water,
fit for such a womanly stomach as yours, Doctor. With this, and
a pipe of tobacco, and perhaps a song and (when your Worship
hath gone to bed) a dance from one of the girls&mdash;I say, my lad,
with this I shall be ready to forget Sedgemoor and to forgive
Judge Jeffreys. When we are tired of Barbadoes, we will take
boat and sail away. I know one island, at least, where they care
nothing for King James. Thither will we go, my lad.'</p>

<p>Well; what we found at our port, and how we fared, was not
quite as Barnaby expected and hoped, as you shall hear. But
I must admire the cunning of the man Penne, who not only took
from Alice&mdash;poor child!&mdash;all her brother's money, amounting to
two hundred and fifty pounds or thereabouts (which you have
read), on the pretext of bestowing it for the advantage of all, but
also received two hundred guineas from Mr. Boscorel on the same<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
pretence. This made in all four hundred and fifty pounds. And
not one penny&mdash;not a single penny&mdash;of this great sum did the
man spend upon the purpose for which it was given him.</p>

<p>You have heard how the merchants and planters came aboard
the ships which put in with servants and slaves, and how these
are put up for sale one at a time. As was the sale described by
Alice, just such was ours: though, I take it, our lads were not
so miserable a company as were those on board her ship. Pale of
cheek they looked, and dejected, and some were sick with various
disorders, caused by the confinement of the prison or the sufferings
of the voyage. They put us up one after the other and we were
sold. I forget what I myself fetched, and, indeed, it matters not,
save that many jests were passed at our expense, and that when
one was put up&mdash;as Robin, for instance&mdash;who had been a Captain
in the rebel army, the salesman was eloquent in praise of his rich
and illustrious family, who would never endure that this unfortunate
man should continue in servitude. But Barnaby put his
tongue in his cheek and laughed.</p>

<p>When the sale was concluded, we were bundled into boats and
taken ashore to the barracoon, of which you have heard from Alice.
Here the same officer who read to her party the laws concerning
servants and their duties, and the punishments which await transgressors,
read them also to ourselves.</p>

<p>'Faith,' Barnaby whispered, 'there will be a great scoring of
backs before many days are done, unless their bark is worse than
their bite.'</p>

<p>This business despatched, I thought it was time to present my
letter. Therefore I stepped forward, and informed the officer, who,
by reason of his gown and wig and the beadles who were with him,
I judged to be some lawyer, that, with my cousin and another, I
held a letter which should hold us free from servitude.</p>

<p>'Ay, ay,' he said. 'Where is that letter?'</p>

<p>So I gave it to him. 'Twas addressed to one Jonathan Polwhele,
and enjoined him to receive the three prisoners, named
Humphrey Challis, Robin Challis, and Barnaby Eykin, to pay for
them such sums as would reasonably be required to redeem them
from servitude, and to advance them such moneys as they would
want at the outset for maintenance, the whole to be accounted for
in Mr. Jonathan Polwhele's next despatches to his obedient, much
obliged servant, G. P.</p>

<p>'Sir,' said the officer, when he had read the letter through,
'this epistle is addressed to one Jonathan Polwhele. There is no
merchant or planter of that name on the whole island.'</p>

<p>He gave me back the letter. 'If this,' he said, 'is all you
have to show, there is no reason why you and your friends should
not march with the rest.'</p>

<p>Truly, we had nothing else to show. Not only was there no
one named Polwhele on the island, but there never had been
any one of that name. Therefore it was plain that we had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
tricked, and that the man George Penne was a villain. Alas!
poor Barnaby. Where now were his cool cups and his pipe of
tobacco? Then the officer beckoned to a gentleman&mdash;a sober and
grave person&mdash;standing near, and spoke to him.</p>

<p>'Gentlemen,' said the merchant, 'permit me to read this letter.
So, it is in the handwriting of Mr. George Penne, which I know
well. There is here some strange mistake. The letter is addressed
to Mr. Jonathan Polwhele; but there is no one of that name in
the place. I am myself Mr. Penne's correspondent in this island.
My name, gentlemen, is Sefton, not Polwhele.'</p>

<p>'Sir,' I said, 'do you know Mr. Penne?'</p>

<p>'I have never seen him. He consigns to my care once or twice
a year a cargo of transported servants, being rogues and thieves,
sent here, instead of to the gallows. He ships them to my care,
I say, as he hath shipped the company arrived this morning; and I
sell them for him, taking for my share a percentage, as agreed
upon, and remitting to him the balance in sugar and tobacco.'</p>

<p>'Is there no letter from him?'</p>

<p>'There is a letter in which he advises me of so many rebels
consigned to me in order to be sold. Some among them, he says,
were captains and officers in Monmouth's army, and some are of
good family, among whom he especially names Robin and Humphrey
Challis. But there is not a word about ransom.'</p>

<p>'Sir,' I said, knowing nothing as yet of Alice and her money,
'two hundred guineas have been paid to Mr. Penne by the Rev.
Philip Boscorel, Rector of Bradford Orcas, in the county of
Somerset, for our ransom.'</p>

<p>'Nothing is said of this,' he replied gravely. 'Plainly, gentlemen,
without despatches from Mr. Penne I cannot act for you.
You have a letter; it is written by that gentleman; it is addressed
to Mr. Polwhele; it says nothing about Barbadoes, and would
serve for Jamaica or Virginia. So great a sum as two hundred
guineas cannot have been forgotten. I exhort you, therefore, to patience
until other letters arrive. Why, two hundred guineas would
have gone far to redeem you all three, and to maintain you for a
great while. Gentlemen, I am grieved for you, because there is
for the present no help for it, but that you must go with the planter
who hath bought you, and obey his orders. I will, however, send
to Mr. Penne an account of this charge, and I would advise that
you lose no time in writing to your friends at home.'</p>

<p>'Heart up, lad!' cried Barnaby, for I turned faint upon this
terrible discovery, and would have fallen, but he held me up.
'Patience; our turn will come.'</p>

<p>'Write that letter,' said the merchant again. 'Write that letter
quickly, so that it may go with the next vessel. Otherwise the
work is hard and the heat is great.' So he turned and left us.</p>

<p>'Courage, man!' said Barnaby. 'To every dog his day. If
now for five minutes only I could have my thumb on Mr. Penne's
windpipe and my fingers round his neck! And I thought to spend<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
the evening joyfully at Mother Rosemary's! Courage, lad! I
have seen already,' he whispered, 'a dozen boats in the bay, any
one of which will serve our turn.'</p>

<p>But Robin paid no heed, whatever happened. He stood up
when his name was called, and was sold without showing any emotion.
When we found that we had been tricked he seemed as if he
neither heard nor regarded.</p>

<p>When all was ready we were marched, twenty in number, along
a white and dusty road to our estate. By great good fortune&mdash;rather
by Providence&mdash;we were all bought by the same master.
He was, it is true, a bad man; but to be bought all together was
a happiness which we could not expect. He bought us all because
he understood that we belonged to the same family (and that one
of position), in the hope of receiving substantial ransom. This
man rode with us, accompanied by two overseers (these were themselves
under the same sentence) who cracked their whips continually,
and cursed us if we lagged. Their bark was worse, we afterwards
found, than their bite, for it was only in the master's presence
that they behaved thus brutishly, and in order to curry favour with
him and to prevent being reduced again to the rank of those who
served in the field. There was no doubt, from the very outset,
that we were afflicted with a master whose like, I would hope, is
not to be found upon the island of Barbadoes. Briefly, he was
one whose appearance, voice, and manner all alike proclaimed him
openly to all the world as a drunkard, a profligate, and a blasphemer.
A drunkard he was of that kind who are seldom wholly
drunk and yet are never sober; who begin the day with a glass and
go on taking more glasses all day long, with small ale for breakfast,
strong ale and Madeira for dinner, a tankard in the afternoon, and
for supper more strong ale and Madeira, and before bed another
tankard. As for compassion, or tenderness, or any of the virtues
which a man who holds other men in slavery ought to possess, he
had none of them.</p>

<p>Let me speak of him with no more bitterness than is necessary.
We have, I think, all forgiven him, and he hath long since gone to
a place where he can do no more harm to any, but awaiteth judgment&mdash;perhaps
in the sure and certain hope of which the funeral
service speaks&mdash;but this is open to doubt.</p>

<p>When we were arrived at the estate, the master dismounted,
gave his horse to a negro, and ordered us to be drawn up in
line.</p>

<p>He then made a short speech. He said that he had bought us,
rebels and villains as we were, and that he meant to get his money's
worth out of us or he would cut us all to pieces. Other things he
told us, which I pass over because they were but repetitions of this
assurance. He then proceeded to examine us in detail. When he
came to me he cursed and swore because he said he had been made
to pay for a sound, proper man, and had got a crookback for his
bargain. I told him that, with submission, he might find the crookback,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
who was a physician, a more profitable bargain than many a
stronger man.</p>

<p>'What?' he roared. 'Thou art a physician, eh? Wouldst
slink out of the field-work and sit idle among bottles and boluses?
John'&mdash;he turned to one of the overseers&mdash;'pay particular attention,
I command thee, to this learned physician. If he so much as
turn round in his work, make his shoulders smart.'</p>

<p>'Ay, ay, Sir,' said the overseer.</p>

<p>'And what art thou, sirrah?' He turned next to Barnaby.
'Another learned physician, no doubt&mdash;or a Divine, a Bishop
likely, or a Dean at the least?'</p>

<p>'As for what I was,' said Barnaby, 'that is neither here nor
there. For what I am, I suppose I am your servant for ten
years, or until our pardons are sent us.'</p>

<p>'Thou art an impudent dog, I dare swear,' returned the master.
'I remember now. Thou wast a Captain in the rebel army, once
a sailor. Well, take care, lest thou taste the cat.'</p>

<p>'Gentlemen who are made to taste the cat,' said Barnaby, 'are
apt to remember the taste of it when their time is up.'</p>

<p>'What?' he cried. 'You dare to threaten? Take that&mdash;and
that!' and so began to belabour him about the head. I trembled
lest Barnaby should return the blows. But he did not. He only
held up his arm to protect his head, and presently, when the master
desisted, he shook himself like a dog.</p>

<p>'I promise you I shall remember the taste of that wood,' he
said quietly.</p>

<p>The master looked as if he would renew the cudgelling, but
thought better of it.</p>

<p>Then, without more violence, we were assigned our quarters.
A cottage or hut was given to us. We were served with a hammock,
and a rug each; a pannikin, basin, spoon and platter for each; a
Monmouth cap; two shirts, common and coarse; two pairs of canvas
breeches, and a pair of shoes for each&mdash;so that we looked for
all the world like the fellows who live by loading and unloading the
ships in the port of Bristol. Yet the change after the long voyage
was grateful. They served us next with some of the stuff they call
loblollie, and then the night fell and we lay down in our hammocks,
which were certainly softer than the planks of the ship, and then
fell fast asleep in spite of the humming and the biting of the
merrywings, and so slept till the break of day.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XL.</h2>

<h3>WITH THE HOE.</h3>


<div class="drop">
<img src="images/i_299.jpg" alt="B" width="100" height="102" class="cap" />
 <p class="cap_1">Before it was daylight we were aroused by the discordant
clang of a bell: work was about to begin.</p>
</div>

<p>In these latitudes there is little twilight; the day
begins, as it ends, with a kind of suddenness. I
arose, being thus summoned, and looked out. Long
rays of light were shooting up the sky from the East, and, though
the stars were still visible, the day was fast breaking. In a few
moments it became already so light that I could see across the
yard&mdash;or what the Italians would call the piazza&mdash;with its ragged
bonannow-leaves, the figures of our fellow-slaves moving about the
huts, and hear their voices. Alas! sad and melancholy are the
voices of those who work upon his Majesty's Plantations. Two
old negresses went about among the new-comers, carrying a bucketful
of their yellow mess, which they distributed among us, and
giving us to understand that this bowl of yellow porridge, or loblollie,
made out of Indian corn, was all we should have before
dinner. They also gave us to understand in their broken English,
which is far worse than the jargon talked by some of our country
people, that we should have to prepare our own meals for the
future, and that they would show us how to make this delectable
mess.</p>

<p>'Eat it,' said Barnaby; 'a pig is better fed at home. Eat it,
Robin, lest thou faint in the sun. Perhaps there will be something
better for dinner. Heigho! only to think of Mother Rosemary's,
where I thought to lie last night! Patience, lads!'</p>

<p>One would not seem to dwell too long on the simple fare of
convicts: therefore I will say, once for all, that our rations consisted
of nothing at all but the Indian meal and of salt beef or salt
fish. The old hands and the negro slaves know how to improve
their fare in many ways, and humane masters will give their servants
quantities of the fruits such as grow here in great abundance&mdash;as
plantains, lemons, limes, bonannows, guavas, and the
like. And many of the black slaves have small gardens behind
their huts, where they grow onions, yams, potatoes, and other
things which they cultivate on Sundays. They are all great thieves
also, stealing, whenever they can, poultry, eggs, and fruit, so that
they grow fat and sleek, while the white servants daily grow more
meagre, and fall into diseases by reason of the poorness of their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
food. Then, as to drink, there are many kinds of drink (apart
from the wines of Spain, Portugal, Canary, Madeira, and France)
made in the country itself, such as mobbie, which is a fermented
liquor of potatoes; and perino, from the liquor of chewed cassavy
root; punch, which is water and sugar left to work for ten days;
rum, which is distilled in every Ingenio, and is a spirit as strong
as brandy, and said to be more wholesome. Those who have been
long in the island, even the servants, though without a penny,
know how and where to get these drinks; and, since there is no
consoler, to the common sort, so good as strong drink, those who
are able to drink every day of these things become somewhat
reconciled to their lot.</p>

<p>'Come out, ye dogs of rebels and traitors!' It was the loud
and harsh voice of the master himself, who thus disturbed us at
our breakfast. 'Twas his custom thus to rise early, and to witness
the beginning of the day's work. And 'twas his kindly nature
which impelled him thus to welcome and encourage his newly-bought
slaves. 'Come out, I say! Ye shall now show of what
stuff ye are made. Instead of pulling down your lawful King, ye
shall pull up your lawful master and make him rich. If ye never
did a day's work in your lives, ye shall now learn the how by the
must. Come forth, I say, ye lazy, guzzling skulkers!'</p>

<p>'Ay, ay,' said Barnaby, leisurely scraping his bowl, 'we are
like, indeed, to be overfed here.' He rolled sailor fashion out of
the hut.</p>

<p>'Barnaby,' I said, 'for God's sake, say nothing to anger the
master! There is no help but in patience and in hope.'</p>

<p>So we, too, went forth. The master, red-faced as he was,
looked as if he had been drinking already.</p>

<p>'So,' he cried, 'here is the learned physician. Your health,
Doctor. And here is the gallant Captain, who was once a sailor.
The air of the fields, Captain, will remind you, perchance, of the
quarter-deck. This young gentleman looks so gallant and gay
that I warrant he will ply the hoe with a light and frolick heart.
Your healths, gentlemen. Hark ye, now. You are come of a
good stock, I hear. Therefore have I bought you at a great price,
looking to get my money back and more. Some planters would
suffer you to lie at your ease cockered up with bonavist and Madeira
till the money comes. As for me, I shall now show you what you
will continue to do, unless the money comes. Therefore you will
at once, I doubt not, ask for paper and pen and presently write.
Sixty pounds a-piece, gentlemen&mdash;not one penny less&mdash;will purchase
your freedom. Till then, the fields. And no difference
between white and black; but one whip for both.'</p>

<p>We made no reply, but took the hoes which were given out to
us and marched with the rest of the melancholy troop.</p>

<p>There were as many blacks as whites. We were divided into
gangs; with every gang a driver armed with a whip; and over all
the overseers, who, by their severity, showed their zeal for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
master. The condition of slavery hath in it something devilish,
both for those who are slaves and those who are masters. The
former it drives into despair, and fills with cunning, dishonesty,
treachery, and revenge. Why, the black slaves have been known
to rise in rebellion, and while they had the power have inflicted
tortures unheard-of upon their masters. The latter it makes cruel
and unfeeling; it tempts them continually to sins of all kinds; it
puts into their power the lives, the bodies&mdash;nay, the very souls&mdash;of
the poor folk whom they buy. I do maintain, and conceal not
my opinion, that no man ought, in a Christian country, to be a
slave except for a term of years, and then for punishment. I have
been myself a slave, and I know the misery and the injustice of
the condition. But it is idle to hope that the planters will abandon
this means of cultivating their estates, and it is certain that in hot
countries no man will work except by compulsion.</p>

<p>The whip carried by the driver is a dreadful instrument, long,
thick, and strongly plaited, with a short handle. It is coiled and
slung round the shoulders when it is not being used to terrify or
to punish, and I know well that its loud crack produces upon the
mind a sensation of fear and of horror such as the thunder of
artillery or the sight of the enemy charging could never cause even
to a coward. The fellows are also extremely dexterous in the use of
it; they can inflict a punishment not worse than the flogging of a
schoolboy; or, with no greater outward show of strength, they
will cut and gash the flesh like a Russian executioner with the
cruel instrument which they call the knout.</p>

<p>For slight offences, such as laziness or carelessness in the field,
the former is administered; but for serious offences, the latter.
One sad execution (I cannot call it less) I myself witnessed. What
the poor wretch had done I know not, but I can never forget his
piercing shrieks as the whip cut into the bleeding flesh. This is
not punishment: it is savage and revengeful cruelty. Yet the
master and the overseers looked on with callous eyes.</p>

<p>They marched us to a field about half a mile from our village or
camp, and there, drawing us up in line, set us to work. Our task
was, with the hoe, to dig out square holes, each of the same depth
and size, in which the sugar canes are planted, a small piece of old
cane being laid in each. These holes are cut with regularity and
exactness, in long lines and equally distant from each other. It is
the driver's business to keep all at work at the same rate of progress,
so that no one should lag behind, no one should stop to rest or
breathe, no one should do less than his neighbours. The poor
wretches, with bent bodies streaming with their exertions, speedily
become afflicted with a burning thirst; their legs tremble; their
backs grow stiff and ache; their whole bodies become full of pain;
and yet they may not rest nor stand upright to breathe a while,
nor stop to drink, until the driver calls a halt. From time to time
the negroes&mdash;men and women alike&mdash;were dragged out of the ranks
and laid on the ground three or four at a time, to receive lashes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
for not making the holes deep enough or fast enough. At home
one can daily see the poor creatures flogged in Bridewell; every
day there are rogues tied to the cart-wheel and flogged wellnigh
to death; but a ploughman is not flogged for the badness of his
furrow, nor is a cobbler flogged because he maketh his shoon ill.
And our men do not shriek and scream so wildly as the negroes,
who are an ignorant people and have never learned the least self-restraint.
It was horrid also to see how their bodies were scarred
with the marks of old floggings, and branded with letters to show
by whom they had been bought. As for our poor fellows, who
had been brave recruits in Monmouth's army, they trembled at
the sight and worked all the harder; yet some of them with the
tears in their eyes, to think that they should be brought to such a
dismal fate and to herd with these poor, ignorant, black people.</p>

<p>'Twas the design of the master to set us to the very hardest
work from the beginning, so that we should be the more anxious
to get remission of our pains. For it must not be supposed that
all the work on the estate was so hard and irksome as that with
the hoe&mdash;which is generally kept for the strongest and hardest of
the negroes, men and women. There are many other employments:
some are put to weed the canes, some to fell wood, some to cleave
it, some to attend the Ingenio, the boiling-house, the still-house,
the curing-house; some to cut the maize, some to gather provisions,
of bonavist, maize, yams, potatoes, cassavy, and the like. Some
to the smith's forge; some to attend to the oxen and sheep; some
to the camels and assinegoes, and the like: so that, had the master
pleased, he might have set us to work better fitted to English gentlemen.
Well, his greediness and cruelty were defeated, as you
shall presently see. As for the domestic economy of the estate,
there were on it five hundred acres of land, of which two hundred
were planted with sugar, eighty for pasture, one hundred and
twenty for wood, thirty for tobacco, five for ginger, and as many
for cotton-wool, and seventy for provisions&mdash;viz. corn, potatoes,
plantains, cassavy, and bonavist&mdash;with a few for fruit. There
were ninety-six negroes, two or three Indian women with their
children, and twenty-eight Christian servants, of whom we were
three.</p>

<p>At eleven o'clock we were marched back to dinner. At one we
went out again, the sun being at this time of the day very fierce,
though January is the coldest month in the year. We worked till
six o'clock in the evening, when we returned.</p>

<p>'This,' said Robin, with a groan, 'is what we have now to do
every day for ten years.'</p>

<p>'Heart up, lads!' said Barnaby; 'our time will come. Give
me time to turn round, as a body may say. Why, the harbour is
full of boats. Let me get to the port and look round a bit. If we
had any money now&mdash;but that is past praying for. Courage and
patience! Doctor, you hoe too fast: no one looks for zeal. Follow
the example of the black fellows, who think all day long how<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
they shall get off with as little work as possible. As for their lash,
I doubt whether they dare to lay it about us, though they may
talk. Because you see, even if we do not escape, we shall some
time or other, through the Rector's efforts, get a pardon, and then
we are gentlemen again; and when that moment arrives I will
make this master of ours fight, willy-nilly, and I will kill him, d'ye
see, before I go home to kill Benjamin.'</p>

<p>He then went on to discourse (either with the hope of raising
our spirits or because it cheered his mind just to set them forth)
upon his plans for the means of escape.</p>

<p>'A boat,' he said, 'I can seize. There are many which would
serve our purpose. But a boat without victuals would be of little
use. One would not be accused of stealing, yet we may have to
break into the store and take therefrom some beef or biscuit. But
where to store our victuals? We may have a voyage of three or
four hundred knots before us. That is nothing for a tight little
boat when the hurricane season is over. We have no compass
either&mdash;I must lay hands upon a compass. The first Saturday
night I will make for the port and cast about. Lift up your head,
Robin. Why, man, all bad times pass if only one hath patience.'</p>

<p>It was this very working in the fields, by which the master
thought to drive us into despair, which caused in the long run our
deliverance, and that in the most unexpected manner.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XLI.</h2>

<h3>ON CONDITIONS.</h3>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 245px;">
<img src="images/i_304.jpg" width="245" height="350" alt="This" />

</div>


<p>This servitude endured for
a week, during which we
were driven forth daily
with the negroes to the
hardest and most intolerable
toil, the master's intention
being so to disgust
us with the life as to make
us write the most urgent letters to
our friends at home; since, as we
told him two hundred guineas had
been already paid on our account
(though none of the money was used
for the purpose), he supposed that
another two hundred could easily be
raised. Wherefore, while those of the new servants
who were common country lads were placed
in the Ingenio, or the curing-house, where the
work is sheltered from the scorching sun, we
were made to endure every hardship that the
place permitted. In the event, however, the
man's greed was disappointed and his cruelty
made of none avail.</p>

<p>In fact, the thing I had foreseen quickly
came to pass. When a man lies in a lethargy
of despair, his body, no longer fortified by a cheerful mind,
presently falls into any disease which is lurking in the air. Diseases
of all kinds may be likened unto wild beasts: invisible,
always on the prowl, seeking whom they may devour. The young
fall victims to some, the weak to others; the drunkards and gluttons
to others; the old to others; and the lethargic, again, to
others. It was not surprising to me, therefore, when Robin, coming
home one evening, fell to shivering and shaking, chattering with
his teeth, and showing every external sign of cold, though the
evening was still warm, and the sun had that day been more than
commonly hot. Also, he turned away from his food, and would
eat nothing. Therefore, as there was nothing we could give him,
we covered him with our rugs; and he presently fell asleep. But
in the morning, when we awoke, behold! Robin was in a high
fever: his hands and head burning hot, his cheek flushed red, his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
eyes rolling, and his brain wandering. I went forth and called the
overseer to come and look at him. At first he cursed and swore,
saying that the man was malingering (that is to say, pretending to
be sick, in order to avoid work); that, if he was a negro instead of
a gentleman, a few cuts with his lash should shortly bring him to
his senses; that, for his part, he liked not this mixing of gentlemen
with negroes; and that, finally, I must go and bring forth my sick
man or take it upon myself to face the master, who would probably
drive him afield with the stick.</p>

<p>'Sir,' I said, 'what the master may do I know not. Murder
may be done by any who are wicked enough. For my part, I am
a physician, and I tell you that to make this man go forth to work
will be murder. But indeed he is light-headed, and with a thousand
lashes you could not make him understand or obey.'</p>

<p>Well, he grumbled, but he followed me into the hut.</p>

<p>'The man hath had a sunstroke,' he said. 'I wonder that any
of you have escaped. Well, we can carry him to the sick-house,
where he will die. When a new hand is taken this way he always
dies.'</p>

<p>'Perhaps he will not die,' I said, 'if he is properly treated. If
he is given nothing but this diet of loblollie and salt beef, and
nothing to drink but the foul water of the pond, and no other
doctor than an ignorant old negress, he will surely die.'</p>

<p>'Good Lord, man!' said the fellow. 'What do you expect in
this country? It is the master's loss, not mine. Carry him between
you to the sick-house.'</p>

<p>So we carried Robin to the sick-house.</p>

<p>At home we should account it a barn, being a great place with a
thatched roof, the windows open, without shutter or lattice, the door
breaking away from its hinges. Within there was a black lying on a
pallet, groaning most piteously. The poor wretch, for something
that he had done, I know not what, had his flesh cut to pieces with
the whip. With him was an old negress mumbling and mouthing.</p>

<p>We laid Robin on another pallet, and covered him with a rug.</p>

<p>'Now, man,' said the overseer, 'leave him there, and come
forth to your work.'</p>

<p>'Nay,' I said, 'he must not be left. I am a physician, and I
must stay beside him.'</p>

<p>'If he were your son I would not suffer you to stay with him.'</p>

<p>'Man!' I cried. 'Hast thou no pity?'</p>

<p>'Pity!' The fellow grinned. 'Pity! quotha. Pity! Is this
a place for pity? Why, if I showed any pity I should be working
beside you in the fields. It is because I have no pity that I am
overseer. Look here'&mdash;he showed me his left hand, which had
been branded with a red-hot iron. 'This was done in Newgate
seven years ago and more. Three years more I have to serve.
That done, I may begin to show some pity. Not before. Pity is
scarce among the drivers of Barbadoes. As well ask the beadle for
pity when he flogs a 'prentice.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span></p>

<p>'Let me go to the master, then.'</p>

<p>'Best not; best not. Let this man die and keep yourself
alive. The morning is the worst time for him, because last night's
drink is still in his head. Likely as not you will but make the
sick man's case and your own worse. Leave him in the sick-house,
and go back to him in the evening.'</p>

<p>The man spoke with some compassion in his eyes. Just then,
however, a negro boy came running from the house and spoke to
the overseer.</p>

<p>'Why,' he said, 'nothing could be more pat. You can speak to
the master, if you please. He is in pain, and Madam sends for
Dr. Humphrey Challis. Go, Doctor. If you cure him, you will be
a lucky man. If you cannot cure him, the Lord have mercy upon
you! Whereas, if you suffer him to die,' he added with a grin and
a whisper, 'every man on the estate will fall down and worship
you. Let him die! Let him die!'</p>

<p>I followed the boy, who took me to that part of the house
which fronts the west and north. It was a mean house of wood,
low and small, considering how wealthy a man was the master of
it; on three sides, however, there was built out a kind of <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">loggia</i>, as
the Italians call it, of wood instead of marble, forming a cloister or
open chamber, outside the house. They call it a verandah, and
part of it they hang with mats made of grass, so as to keep it
shaded in the afternoon and evening, when the sun is in the west.
The boy brought me to this place, pointed to a chair where the
master sat, and then ran away as quickly as he could.</p>

<p>It was easy to understand why he ran away, because the master
at this moment sprang out of his chair and began to stamp up and
down the verandah, roaring and cursing. He was clad in a white
linen dressing-gown and linen nightcap. On a small table beside
him stood a bottle of beer, newly opened, and a silver tankard.</p>

<p>When he saw me he began to swear at me for my delay in
coming, though I had not lost a moment.</p>

<p>'Sir,' I said, 'if you will cease railing and blaspheming I will
examine into your malady. Otherwise I will do nothing for you.'</p>

<p>'What?' he cried. 'You dare to make conditions with me,
you dog, you!'</p>

<p>'Fair words,' I said. 'Fair words. I am your servant to work
on your plantation as you may command. I am not your physician;
and I promise you, Sir, upon the honour of a gentleman, and without
using the sacred name which is so often on your lips, that if
you continue to rail at me I will suffer you to die rather than stir a
little finger in your help.'</p>

<p>'Suffer the physician to examine the place,' said a woman's
voice. 'What good is it to curse and to swear?'</p>

<p>The voice came from a hammock swinging at the end of the
verandah. It was made, I observed, of a land of coarse grass
loosely woven.</p>

<p>The man sat down and sulkily bade me find a remedy for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
pain which he was enduring. So I consented and examined his
upper jaw, where I soon found out the cause of his pain in a good-sized
tumour formed over the fangs of a grinder. Such a thing
causes agony even to a person of cool blood, but to a man whose
veins are inflamed with strong drink the pain of it is maddening.</p>

<p>'You have got a tumour,' I told him. 'It has been forming for
some days. It has now nearly, or quite, reached its head. It began
about the time when you were cursing and insulting certain unfortunate
gentlemen, who are for a time under your power. Take it,
therefore, as a Divine judgment upon you for your cruelty and
insolence.'</p>

<p>He glared at me, but said nothing, the hope of relief causing
him to receive this admonition with patience, if not in good part.
Besides, my finger was still upon the spot, and if I so much as
pressed gently I could cause him agony unspeakable. Truly, the
power of the physician is great.</p>

<p>'The pain,' I told him, 'is already grown almost intolerable.
But it will be much greater in a few hours unless something is
done. It is now like unto a little ball of red-hot fire in your jaw;
in an hour or two it will seem as if the whole of your face was a
burning fiery furnace; your cheek will swell out until your left eye
is closed; your tortures, which now make you bawl, will then
make you scream; you now walk about and stamp; you will then
lie down on your back and kick. No negro slave ever suffered half
so much under your accursed lash as you will suffer under this
tumour&mdash;unless something is done.'</p>

<p>'Doctor,' it was again the woman's voice from the hammock,
'you have frightened him enough.'</p>

<p>'Strong drink,' I went on, pointing to the tankard, 'will only
make you worse. It inflames your blood and adds fuel to the raging
fire. Unless something is done the pain will be followed by
delirium; that by fever, and the fever by death. Sir, are you
prepared for death?'</p>

<p>He turned horribly pale and gasped.</p>

<p>'Do something for me!' he said. 'Do something for me, and
that without more words!'</p>

<p>'Nay; but I will first make a bargain with you. There is in
the sick-house a gentleman, my cousin&mdash;Robin Challis by name&mdash;one
of the newly-arrived rebels, and your servant. He is lying
sick unto death of a sunstroke and fever caused by your hellish
cruelty in sending him out to work on the fields with the negroes
instead of putting him to light labour in the Ingenio or elsewhere.
I say, his sickness is caused by your barbarity. Wherefore I will
do nothing for you at all&mdash;do you hear? Nothing! nothing!&mdash;unless
I am set free to do all I can for him. Yea; and I must have
such cordials and generous diet as the place can afford, otherwise I
will not stir a finger to help you. Otherwise&mdash;endure the torments
of the damned; rave in madness and in fever. Die and go to your
own place. I will not help you. So; that is my last word.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span></p>

<p>Upon this I really thought the man had gone stark, staring
mad. For, at the impudence of a mere servant (though a gentleman
of far better family than his own) daring to make conditions
with him, he became purple in the cheeks, and, seizing his great
stick which lay on the table, he began belabouring me with all his
might about the head and shoulders. But I caught up a chair and
used it for a shield, while he capered about, striking wildly and
swearing most horribly.</p>

<p>At this moment the lady who was in the hammock stepped out
of it and walked towards us slowly, like a Queen. She was without
any doubt the most beautiful woman I had ever seen. She
was dressed in a kind of dressing-gown of flowered silk, which
covered her from head to foot; her head was adorned with the
most lovely glossy black ringlets; a heavy gold chain lay round her
neck, and a chain of gold with pearls was twined in her hair, so
that it looked like a coronet; her fingers were covered with rings,
and gold bracelets hung upon her bare white arms. Her figure
was tall and full; her face inclined to the Spanish, being full and
yet regular, with large black eyes. Though I was fighting with a
madman, I could not resist the wish that I could paint her, and
I plainly perceived that she was one of that race which is called
Quadroon, being most likely the daughter of a mulatto woman and
a white father. This was evident by the character of her skin,
which had in it what the Italians call the <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">morbidezza</i>, and by a
certain dark hue under the eyes.</p>

<p>'Why,' she said, speaking to the master as if he had been a
petulant school-boy, 'you only make yourself worse by all this
fury. Sit down, and lay aside your stick. And you. Sir'&mdash;she
addressed herself to me&mdash;'you may be a great physician, and at
home a gentleman; but here you are a servant, and therefore
bound to help your master in all you can without first making
conditions.'</p>

<p>'I know too well,' I replied, 'he bought me as his servant, but
not as his physician. I will not heal him without my fee; and my
fee is that my sick cousin be attended to with humanity.'</p>

<p>'Take him away!' cried the master, beside himself with rage.
'Clap him in the stocks! Let him sit there all day long in the
sun! He shall have nothing to eat or to drink! In the evening
he shall be flogged! If it was the Duke of Monmouth himself, he
should be tied up and flogged! Where the devil are the servants?'</p>

<p>A great hulking negro came running.</p>

<p>'You have now,' I told him quietly, 'permitted yourself to be
inflamed with violent rage. The pain will therefore more rapidly
increase. When it becomes intolerable, you will be glad to send
for me.'</p>

<p>The negro dragged me away (but I made no resistance), and led
me to the courtyard, where stood the stocks and a whipping-post.
He pointed to the latter with a horrid grin, and then laid me fast
in the former. Fortunately, he left me my hat, otherwise the hot<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
sun would have made an end of me. I was, however, quite easy in
my mind. I knew that this poor wretch, who already suffered so
horribly, would before long feel in that jaw of his, as it were, a
ball of fire. He would drink, in order to deaden the pain; but the
wine would only make the agony more horrible. Then he would
be forced to send for me.</p>

<p>This, in fact, was exactly what he did.</p>

<p>I sat in those abominable stocks for no more than an hour. Then
Madam herself came to me, followed by the negro fellow who had
locked my heels in those two holes.</p>

<p>'He is now much worse,' she said. 'He is now in pain that
cannot be endured. Canst thou truly relieve his suffering?'</p>

<p>'Certainly I can. But on conditions. My cousin will die if he
is neglected. Suffer me to minister to his needs. Give him what I
want for him and I will cure your'&mdash;I did not know whether I
might say 'your husband,' so I changed the words into&mdash;'my
master. After that I will cheerfully endure again his accursed
cruelty of the fields.'</p>

<p>She bade the negro unlock the bar.</p>

<p>'Come,' she said. 'Let us hear no more about any bargains.
I will see to it that you are able to attend to your cousin. Nay,
there is an unfortunate young gentlewoman here, a rebel, and a
servant like yourself&mdash;for the last week she doth nothing but weep
for the misfortunes of her friends&mdash;meaning you and your company.
I will ask her to nurse the sick man. She will desire nothing
better, being a most tender-hearted woman. And as for you, it
will be easy for you to look after your cousin and your master at
the same time.'</p>

<p>'Then, Madam,' I replied, 'take me to him, and I will speedily
do all I can to relieve him.'</p>

<p>I found my patient in a condition of mind and body most
dangerous. I wondered that he had not already fallen into a fit,
so great was his wrath and so dreadful his pain. He rolled his eyes;
his cheeks were purple; he clenched his fists; he would have
gnashed his teeth but for the pain in his jaws.</p>

<p>'Make yourself easy,' said Madam. 'This learned physician
will cause your pain to cease. I have talked with him and put
him into a better mind.'</p>

<p>The master shook his head as much as to say that a better
mind would hardly be arrived at without the assistance of the
whipping-post; but the emergency of the case prevented that indulgence.
Briefly, therefore, I took out my lancet and pierced the
place, which instantly relieved the pain. Then I placed him in
bed, bled him copiously, and forbade his taking anything stronger
than small-beer. Freedom from pain and exhaustion presently
caused him to fall into a deep and tranquil sleep. After all this was
done I was anxious to see Robin.</p>

<p>'Madam,' I said, 'I have now done all I can. He will awake
at noon, I dare say. Give him a little broth, but not much. There<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
is danger of fever. You had better call me again when he awakes.
Warn him solemnly that rage, revenge, cursing, and beating must
be all postponed until such time as he is stronger. I go to visit
my cousin in the sick-house, where I await your commands.'</p>

<p>'Sir,' she said courteously, 'I cannot sufficiently thank your
skill and zeal. You will find the nurse of whom I spoke in the
sick-house with your cousin. She took with her some cordial, and
will tell me what else you order for your patient. I hope your cousin
may recover. But, indeed'&mdash;&mdash;she stopped and sighed.</p>

<p>'You would say, Madam, that it would be better for him and
for us all to die. Perhaps so. But we must not choose to die,
but rather strive to live, as more in accordance with the Word of
God.'</p>

<p>'The white servants have been hitherto the common rogues and
thieves and sweepings of your English streets,' she said. 'Sturdy
rogues are they all, who fear naught but the lash, and have nothing
of tenderness left but tender skins. They rob and steal; they will
not work, save by compulsion; they are far worse than the negroes
for laziness and drunkenness. I know not why they are sent out,
or why the planters buy them, when the blacks do so much better
serve their turn, and they can without reproach beat and flog the
negroes, while to flog and beat the whites is by some accounted
cruel.'</p>

<p>'All this, Madam, is doubtless true: but my friends are not the
sweepings of the street.'</p>

<p>'No, but you are treated as if you were. It is a new thing having
gentlemen among the servants, and the planters are not yet accustomed
to them. They are a masterful and a wilful folk, the planters
of Barbadoes; from childhood upwards they have their own way,
and brook not opposition. You have seen into what a madness of
wrath you threw the master by your opposition. Believe me, Sir,
the place is not wholesome for you and for your friends. The master
looks to get a profit, not from your labour, but by your ransom.
Sir'&mdash;she looked me very earnestly in the face&mdash;'if you have
friends at home&mdash;if you have any friends at all&mdash;entreat them&mdash;command
them&mdash;immediately to send money for your ransom. It
will not cost them much. If you do not get the money you will
most assuredly die, with the life that you will have to live. All the
white servants die except the very strongest and lustiest. Whether
they work in the fields, or in the garden, or in the Ingenio, or in
the stables, they die. They cannot endure the hot sun and the
hard fare. They presently catch fever, or a calenture, or a cramp,
and so they die. This young gentlewoman who is now with your
cousin will presently fall into melancholy and die. There is no
help for her, or for you&mdash;believe me, Sir&mdash;there is no hope but to
get your freedom.' She broke off here, and never at any other
time spoke to me again upon this subject.</p>

<p>In three weeks' time, indeed, we were to regain our freedom,
but not in the way Madam imagined.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span></p>

<p>Before I go on to tell of the wonderful surprise which awaited
me, I must say that there was, after this day, no more any question
about the field-work for me. In this island, then, there was a
great scarcity of physicians; nay, there were none properly qualified
to call themselves physicians, though a few quacks; the sick servants
on the estates were attended by the negresses, some of whom
have, I confess, a wonderful knowledge of herbs&mdash;in which respect
they may be likened to our countrywomen, who, for fevers, agues,
toothache, and the like, are as good as any physicians in the world.
It was, therefore, speedily rumoured abroad that there was a physician
upon my master's estate, whereupon there was immediately
a great demand for his services; and henceforth I went daily, with
the master's consent, to visit the sick people on the neighbouring
estates&mdash;nay, I was even called upon by his Excellency the
Lieutenant-Governor himself, Mr. Steed, for a complaint from
which he suffered. And I not only gave advice and medicines, but
I also received a fee just as if I had been practising in London.
But the fees went to my master, who took them all, and offered me
no better diet than before. That, however, mattered little, because
wherever I went I asked for, and always received, food of a more
generous kind, and a glass or two of wine, so that I fared well and
kept my health during the short time that we remained upon the
island. I had also to thank Madam for many a glass of Madeira,
dish of cocoa, plate of fruit, and other things, not only for my
patient Robin, but also for myself, and for another, of whom I
have now to speak.</p>

<p>When, therefore, the master was at length free from pain and
in a comfortable sleep, I left him, with Madam's permission, and
sought the sick-house in a most melancholy mood, because I
believed that Robin would surely die, whatever I should do. And
I confess that, having had but little experience of sunstroke and the
kind of fever which followeth upon it, and having no books to consult
and no medicine at hand, I knew not what I could do for him.
And the boasted skill of the physician, one must confess, availeth
little against a disease which hath once laid hold upon a man. 'Tis
better for him so to order the lives of his patients while they are
well as to prevent disease, just as those who dwell beside an unruly
river (as I have seen upon the great river Rhone) build up a high
levÃ©e, or bank, over which it cannot pass.</p>

<p>In the sick-house the floor was of earth, without boards; there
was no other furniture but two or three wooden beds, on each a
coarse mattress with a rug; and all was horribly filthy, unwashed,
and foul. Beside the pallet where Robin lay there knelt, praying,
a woman with her head in her hands. Heavens! there was, then,
in this dark and heathenish place one woman who still remembered
her Maker!</p>

<p>Robin was awake. His restless eyes rolled about; his hands
clutched uneasily at his blanket; and he was talking. Alas! the
poor brain, disordered and wandering, carried him back to the old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
village. He was at home again in imagination, though we were so
far away. Yea; he had crossed the broad Atlantic, and was in
fair Somerset, among the orchards and the hills. And, only to hear
him talk, the tears rolled down my cheeks.</p>

<p>'Alice,' he said. Alas! he thought that he was again with the
sweet companion of his youth. 'Alice; the nuts are ripe in the
woods. We will to-morrow take a basket and go gather them.
Benjamin shall not come to spoil sport. Besides, he would want
to eat them all himself. Humphrey shall come, and you, and I.
That will be enough.'</p>

<p>Then his thoughts changed again. 'Oh! my dear,' he said&mdash;in
a moment he had passed over ten years, and was now with his
mistress, a child no longer. 'My dear, thou hast so sweet a face.
Nowhere in the whole world is there so sweet a face. I have
always loved thy face; not a day but it has been in my mind&mdash;always
my love, my sweetheart, my soul, my life. My dear, we
will never leave the country; we want no grandeur of rank, and
state, and town; we will always continue here. Old age shall find
us lovers still. Death cannot part us, oh! my dear, save for a
little while&mdash;and then sweet Heaven will unite us again to love each
other for ever, and for ever'&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>'Oh! Robin! Robin! Robin!'</p>

<p>I knew that voice. Oh! Heavens! was I dreaming? Was I,
too, wandering? Were we all back in Somerset?</p>

<p>For the voice was none other than the voice of Alice herself!</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XLII.</h2>

<div class="drop">
<img src="images/i_313.jpg" alt="A" width="100" height="101" class="cap" />
 <p class="cap_1">'Alice!' I cried.</p>
</div>

<p>She rose from her knees and turned to meet me.
Her face was pale; her eyes were heavy and they
were full of tears.</p>

<p>'Alice!'</p>

<p>'I saw you when you came here, a week ago,' she
said. 'Oh! Humphrey, I saw you, and I was ashamed to let you
know that I was here.'</p>

<p>'Ashamed? My dear, ashamed? But how&mdash;why&mdash;what dost
thou here?'</p>

<p>'How could I meet Robin's eyes after what I had done?'</p>

<p>'It was done for him, and for his mother, and for all of us.
Poor child, there is no reason to be ashamed.'</p>

<p>'And now I meet him, and he is in a fever, and his mind
wanders; he knows me not.'</p>

<p>'He is sorely stricken, Alice; I know not how the disease may
end; mind and body are sick alike. For the mind I can do
nothing; for the body I can do but little: yet with cleanliness and
good food we may help him to mend. But tell me, Child, in the
name of Heaven, how camest thou in this place?'</p>

<p>But before anything she would attend to the sick man. And
presently she brought half-a-dozen negresses, who cleaned and
swept the place, and sheets were fetched and a linen shirt, in which
we dressed our patient, with such other things as we could devise
for his comfort. Then I bathed his head with cold water, continually
changing his bandages so as to keep him cool; and I took
some blood from him, but not much, because he was greatly reduced
by bad food and hard work.</p>

<p>When he was a little easier we talked. But, Heavens! to think
of the villainy which had worked its will upon this poor child! As
if it was not enough that she should be forced to fly from a man who
had so strangely betrayed her, and as if it was not enough that she
should be robbed of all her money&mdash;but she must also be put on
board, falsely and treacherously, as one, like ourselves, sentenced
to ten years' servitude on the Plantations! For, indeed, I knew
and was quite certain that none of the Maids of Taunton were thus
sent abroad. It was notorious, before we were sent away, that,
with the exception of Susan Blake, who died of jail-fever at Dorchester,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
all the Maids were given to the Queen's ladies, and by
them suffered to go free on the payment by their parents of thirty
or forty pounds apiece. And as for Alice, she was a stranger in
the place, and it was not known that she had joined that unfortunate
procession. So that, if ever a man was kidnapper and
villain, that man was George Penne.</p>

<p>It behoves a physician to keep his mind under all circumstances
calm and composed. He must not suffer himself to be carried
away by passion, by rage, hatred, or even anxiety. Yet, I confess
that my mind was clean distracted by the discovery that Alice
herself was with us, a prisoner like ourselves; I was, I say, distracted,
nor could I tell what to think of this event and its consequences.
For, to begin with, the poor child was near those who
would protect her. But what kind of protection could be given
by such helpless slaves? Then was she beyond her husband's
reach; he would not, it was quite certain, get possession of her at
this vast distance. So far she was safe. But then the master,
who looked to make a profit by her, as he looked to make a profit
by us&mdash;through the ransom of her friends! She had no friends to
ransom her. There was but one, the Rector, and he was her
husband's father. The time would come when the avarice of the
master would make him do or threaten something barbarous towards
her. Then she had found favour with Madam, this beautiful
mulatto woman, whom Alice innocently supposed to be the master's
wife. And there was the young planter, who wished to buy her
with the honourable intention of marrying her. In short, I knew
not what to think or to say, because at one moment it seemed as if
it was the most Providential thing in the world that Alice should
have been brought here, and the next moment it seemed as if her
presence only magnified our evils.</p>

<p>'Nay,' she said, when I opened my mind to her, 'seeing that
the world is so large, what but a special ruling of Providence
could have brought us all to this same island, out of the whole
multitude of isles&mdash;and then again to this same estate out of so
many? Humphrey, your faith was wont to be stronger. I believe&mdash;nay,
I am quite sure&mdash;that it was for the strengthening and help
of all alike that this hath been ordained. First, it enables me to
nurse my poor Robin&mdash;mine, alas! no longer! Yet must I still
love him as long as I have a heart to beat.'</p>

<p>'Love him always, Child,' I said. 'This is no sin to love the
companion of thy childhood, thy sweetheart, from whom thou
wast torn by the most wicked treachery'&mdash;but could say no more,
because the contemplation of that sweet face, now so mournful,
yet so patient, made my voice to choke and my eyes to fill with
tears. Said I not that a physician must still keep his mind free
from all emotion?</p>

<p>All that day I conversed with her. We agreed that for the present
she should neither acknowledge nor conceal the truth from Madam,
upon whose good-will we now placed all our hopes. That is to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
say, if Madam questioned her she was to acknowledge that we
were her former friends; but, if Madam neither suspected anything
nor asked her anything, she should keep the matter to herself.
She told me during this day all that had happened unto her
since I saw her last, when we marched out of Taunton. Among
other things I heard of the woman called Deb, who was now working
in the canefields (she was one of a company whose duty it was
to weed the canes). In the evening this woman, when the people
returned, came to the sick-house. She was a great strapping
woman, stronger than most men. She was dressed, like all the
women on the estate, in a smock and petticoat, with a thick coif
to keep off the sun, and a pair of strong shoes.</p>

<p>She came to help her mistress, as she fondly called Alice. She
wanted to sit up and watch the sick man, so that her mistress might
go to sleep. But Alice refused. Then this faithful creature rolled herself
up in her rug and laid herself at the door, so that no one should
go in or out without stepping over her. And so she fell asleep.</p>

<p>Then we began our night watch, and talked in whispers, sitting
by the bedside of the fevered man. Presently I forgot the wretchedness
of our condition, the place where we were, our hopeless,
helpless lot, our anxieties and our fears, in the joy and happiness
of once more conversing with my mistress. She spoke to me after
the manner of the old days, but with more seriousness, about the
marvellous workings of the Lord among His people; and presently
we began to talk of the music which we loved to play, and how
the sweet concord and harmony of the notes lift up the soul; and
of pictures and painting, and Mr. Boscorel's drawings and my own
poor attempts, and my studies in the schools, and so forth, as if my
life was, indeed, but just beginning, and, instead of the Monmouth
cap, and the canvas breeches, and common shirt, I was once more
arrayed in velvet, with a physician's wig and a gold-headed cane.</p>

<p>Lastly she prayed, entreating merciful Heaven to bestow health
of mind and enlargement of body to the sick man upon the bed,
and her brother, and her dear friend (meaning myself), and to all
poor sufferers for religion; and she asked that, as it had been
permitted that she should be taken from her earthly lover by
treachery, so it might now be granted to her to lay down her life
for his, so that he might go free and she die in his place.</p>

<p>Through the open window I saw the four stars which make the
constellation they call the 'Crucero,' being like a cross fixed in
the heavens. The night was still, and there was no sound save the
shrill noise of the cigala, which is here as shrill as in Padua. Slave
and master, bondman and free, were all asleep save in this house,
where Robin rolled his heavy head, and murmured without ceasing,
and Alice communed with her God. Surely, surely, I thought,
here was no room for doubt! This my mistress had been brought
here by the hand of God Himself, to be as an angel or messenger
of His own, for our help and succour&mdash;haply for our spiritual help
alone, seeing that no longer was there any help from man.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XLIII.</h2>

<h3>BARNABY HEARS THE NEWS.</h3>


<div class="drop">
<img src="images/i_316.jpg" alt="T" width="100" height="100" class="cap" />
 <p class="cap_1">The master, my patient, got up from his bed in a few
days, somewhat pale and weak after his copious
blood-letting and the drastic medicines with which I
purged the grossness of his habit and expelled the
noxious humours caused by his many intemperances.
These had greatly injured what we call&mdash;because we know not what
nor what else to call it&mdash;the pure volatile spirit, and, so to speak,
turned sour the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">humor radicalis</i>&mdash;the sweet oil and balsamical
virtues of the body. I gave him such counsel as was fitting for his
case, admonishing him urgently to abstain from strong liquors,
except in their moderate use; to drink only after his meals; to
keep his head cool and sober, and above all things to repress and
govern his raging temper, which would otherwise most certainly
catch him by the throat like some fierce and invisible devil and
throw him into a fit, and so kill him. I told him also what might
be meant by the Wise Man (who certainly thought of all the bearings
which his words could have) when he said that one who is
slow to wrath is of great understanding&mdash;namely, that many men
do throw away their lives by falling into excessive fits of rage.
But I found that the words of Holy Scripture had little authority
over him, for he lived without prayer or praise, trampled on the
laws of God, and gave no heed at all to the flight of time and the
coming of the next world.</p>
</div>

<p>For a day or two he followed my injunctions, taking a tankard
of small ale to his breakfast, the same quantity with his dinner, a
pint of Madeira for his supper, and a sober glass or two before
going to bed. But when he grew well, his brother planters came
round him again, the drinking was renewed, and in the morning I
would find him again with parched throat, tongue dry, and shaking
hand, ready to belabour, to curse, and to rail at everybody. If one
wanted an example for the young how strong drink biteth like a
serpent and stingeth like an adder, here was a case the sight of
which might have caused all young men to forswear drunkenness.
Alas! there are plenty of such examples to be seen in every part
of England; yet the younger men still continue to drink, and that,
I think, worse than their fathers. This man, however, who was
not yet five-and-thirty, in the very prime of strong and healthy
manhood, had his finger-joints swollen and stony from taking much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
wine; he commonly ate but little meat, craving continually for
more drink, and his understanding, which was by nature, I doubt
not, clear and strong, was now brutish and stupid. Thinking
over this man, and of the power, even unto death, which he possessed
over his servants and slaves, the words came into my mind:
'It is not for Kings, O Lemuel, it is not for Kings to drink wine;
nor for Princes strong drink.'</p>

<p>Nay, more (and this I say, knowing that many godly men will not
agree with me): I am fully persuaded that there is no man in the
whole world so good and so strong in virtue and religion that he
should be suffered to become the master or despot over any other
man, even over a company of poor and ignorant blacks, or a gang
of transported thieves. When I think of those unhappy people,
driven forth in the morning, heavy-eyed and downcast, to the hard
day's work; and when I remember how they crept home at night,
after being driven, cursed, and beaten all day long; and when I
think upon their drivers, overseers, and masters, and of their hard
and callous hearts, I am moved to cry aloud (if any would hear me)
that to be a slave is wretched indeed; but that to own and to drive
slaves should be a thing most dangerous for any who would continue
members of Christ's Church.</p>

<p>When I told Barnaby the surprising news that his sister was
not only safe, but a servant like ourselves upon the same estate, I
looked that he would rejoice. On the contrary, he fell into a
strange mood, swearing at this ill stroke as he called it. He said
that he never had the least doubt as to her safety, seeing there
were so many in the West Country who knew and respected her
father, and would willingly shelter her. Then he dwelt upon certain
evils&mdash;of which, I confess, I had thought little&mdash;which might
befall her. And, lastly, he set forth with great plainness the increased
dangers in escaping when one has to carry a woman or a
wounded man&mdash;a thing, he pointed out, which had caused his own
capture after Sedgemoor.</p>

<p>Then he opened up to me the whole business of our escape.</p>

<p>'Last Saturday night,' he said, 'while you were sleeping, I
made my way to the port, and, having a shilling or so left, I sought
out a tavern. There is one hard by the Bridge, a house-of-call for
sailors, where I had the good fortune to find a fellow who can do
for us all we want&mdash;if his money hold out, which I doubt. He is
a carver by trade, and a convict, like ourselves; but is permitted
by his master to work at his trade in the town. He hath been, it
is true, branded in the hand; but, Lord! what signifies that? He
was once a thief&mdash;well&mdash;he is now an honest lad again, who asks
for nothing but to get home again. John Nuthall is his name.'</p>

<p>'Go on, Barnaby. We are already in such good company that
another rogue or two matters little.'</p>

<p>'This man came here secretly last night, while you were in the
sick-house. He is very hot upon getting away. And because I am
a sailor and can navigate a craft (which he cannot do) he will take<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
with him not only myself, but also all my party. Now listen,
Humphrey. He hath bought a boat of a Guinea man in the harbour;
and because, to prevent the escape of servants, every boat
is licensed and her owner has to give security to the Governor's
officers, he hath taken this boat secretly up a little creek of which
he knows, and hath there sunk her three feet deep. The masts,
the sails, the oars, and the other gear he hath also safely bestowed
in a secret place. But we cannot sail without water, provisions,
nor without a compass at least. If our party is to consist of Sister,
Robin, you, John Nuthall, and myself&mdash;five in all&mdash;we shall have
to load the boat with provisions, and I must have a compass. I
looked for a boatful with ourselves and John Nuthall. Now we
have Sis as well; and the boat is but small. Where shall we get
provisions? and where shall we lay our hands upon the money to
buy what we want?'</p>

<p>He could talk of nothing else, because his mind was full of his
plan. Yet it seemed to me a most desperate enterprise, thus to
launch a small boat upon the wide ocean, and in this cockle-shell
to brave the waves which are often fatal to the tallest ships.</p>

<p>'Tut, man,' said Barnaby. 'We are not now in the season of
the tornadoes, and there is no other danger upon these seas. I
would as lief be in an open boat as in a brigantine. Sharks may
follow us, but they will not attack a boat; calamaries they talk of,
big enough to lay their arms round the boat and so to drag it
under; but such monsters have I never seen, any more than I have
seen the great whale of Norway or the monstrous birds of the
Southern Seas. There is only one danger, Humphrey, my lad.'
Here he laid his hand upon mine and became mighty serious. 'If
we are taken we shall be flogged&mdash;all of us. Thirty-nine lashes
they will lay on, and they will brand us. For myself, I value not
their thirty-nine lashes a brass farthing, nor their branding with a
hot iron, which can but make a man jump for a day or two. To
me this risk against the chance of escape matters nothing. Why,
when I was cabin-boy I got daily more than thirty-nine lashes&mdash;kicks,
cuffs, and rope's-endings. Nay, I remember, when we sat
over the Latin syntax together my daily ration must have been
thirty-nine, more or less, and Dad's arm was stronger than you
would judge, to look at him. If they catch me, let them lay on
their thirty-nine and be damned to them! But you and Robin, I
doubt, think otherwise.'</p>

<p>'I would not willingly be flogged, Barnaby, if there were any
way of escape&mdash;even by death.'</p>

<p>'So I thought! So I thought!'</p>

<p>'And as for Robin, if he recovers&mdash;which I doubt&mdash;he too, if I
know him, would rather be killed than be flogged.'</p>

<p>'That comes of Oxford!' said Barnaby. 'And then there is
Sis. Humphrey, my lad, it goes to my heart to think of that poor
girl, stripped to be lashed like a black slave or a Bristol drab.'</p>

<p>'Barnaby, she must never run that dreadful risk.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span></p>

<p>'Then she must remain behind, and here she runs that risk
every day. What prevents yon drunken sot&mdash;the taste of that
cudgel still sticks in my gizzard!&mdash;I say, what prevents him from
tying her up to-day, or to-morrow, or every day?'</p>

<p>'Barnaby, I say that she must never run that risk, for if we are
caught&mdash;&mdash;' I stopped.</p>

<p>'Before we are caught, you would say, Humphrey. We are of
the same mind there. But who is to kill her? Not Robin, for he
loves her; not you, because you have too great a kindness for her.
Not I, because I am her brother. What should I say to my
mother when I meet her after we are dead, and she asks me who
killed Alice?'</p>

<p>'Barnaby, if she is to die, let us all die together.'</p>

<p>'Ay,' he replied, 'though I have, I confess, no great stomach
for dying; yet, since we have got her with us, it must be done.
'Tis easy to let the water into the boat, and so, in three minutes,
with no suspicion at all, and my mother never to know anything
about it, she would have said her last prayers, and we should be all
sinking together with never a gasp left.'</p>

<p>I took him after this talk to the sick-house, where Alice was
beginning her second night of nursing. Barnaby saluted his sister
as briefly as if her presence was the thing he most expected.</p>

<p>The room was lit by a horn lanthorn containing a great candle,
which gave enough light to see Robin on the bed and Alice standing
beside him. The woman called Deb was sitting on the floor,
wrapped in her rug.</p>

<p>'Sis,' said Barnaby, 'I have heard from Humphrey how thou
wast cozened out of thy money and enticed on board ship. Well,
this world is full of villains, and I doubt whether I shall live to kill
them all. One I must kill and one I must cudgel. Patience,
therefore, and no more upon this head. Well, Sis, dost love to be
a servant?'</p>

<p>'Surely not, Barnaby.'</p>

<p>'Wouldst like to get thy freedom again?'</p>

<p>'I know not the meaning of thy words, brother. Madam says
that those who have interest at home may procure pardons for their
friends in the Plantations. Also that those whose friends have
money may buy their freedom from servitude. I am sure that Mr.
Boscorel would willingly do this for Robin and for Humphrey; but
for myself&mdash;how can I ask him? How can I ever let him know
where I am and in what condition?'</p>

<p>'Ay, ay, but I meant not that way, child; wilt thou trust
thyself to us?'</p>

<p>She looked at Robin. 'I cannot leave him,' she said.</p>

<p>'No, no; we shall wait until he is dead&mdash;or, perhaps, better.'
But he only added this to please his sister. 'When he is better,
Sis, thou wilt not be afraid to trust thyself with us?'</p>

<p>'I am not afraid of any danger, even of death, with you, if that
is the danger in your mind, Barnaby.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span></p>

<p>'Good! Then we understand each other. There are other
dangers for a young and handsome woman&mdash;and, maybe, worse
dangers. Hast any money at all, by chance?'</p>

<p>'Nay; the man Penne took all my money.'</p>

<p>Barnaby, for five or six minutes without stopping, spoke upon
this topic after the manner of a sailor. 'My turn will come,' he
added. 'No money, child? 'Tis a great pity. Had we a few
gold pieces, now! Some women have rings and chains. But of
course&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Nay, brother; chains I never had, and as for rings, there
were but two that ever I had&mdash;one from Robin, the day that I was
plighted to him; and one from the man who made me marry him,
and put it on in the church. The former did I break and throw
away when I agreed&mdash;for your dear lives&mdash;Barnaby, oh! for the
lives of all'&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>'I know, I know,' said Barnaby. 'Patience&mdash;patience. Oh!
I shall get such a chance some day!'</p>

<p>'The other I threw away when I fled from my husband at the
church door.'</p>

<p>'Ay, ay! If we only had a little money! 'Tis pity that we
should fail for want of a little money.'</p>

<p>'Why,' said Alice, 'I had quite forgotten. I have something
that may bring money.' She pulled from her neck a black ribbon
on which was a little leathern bag. 'Tis the ring the Duke gave
me at Ilchester long ago. I have never parted with it. "God
grant," he said, when he gave it to me, "that it may bring thee
good luck!" Will the ring help, Barnaby?'</p>

<p>I took it first from her hand.</p>

<p>'Why,' I said, 'it is a sweet and costly ring. Jewels I know
and have studied. If I mistake not, these emeralds must be worth
a great sum. But how shall we dispose of so valuable a ring in this
place, and without causing suspicion?'</p>

<p>'Give it to me.' Barnaby took it, looked at it, and laid it, bag
and all, in his pocket. 'There are at the port merchants of all kinds,
who will buy a ship's cargo of sugar one minute and the next will
sell you a red herring. They will also advance money upon a ring.
As for suspicion, there are hundreds of convicts and servants here.
'Tis but to call the ring the property of such an one, and no questions
will be asked. My friend John Nuthall, the carver, shall do
this for us. And now, Sis, I think that our business is as good as
done. Have no fear; we shall get away. First get Robin well,
and then'&mdash;&mdash;Here Barnaby gazed upon her face with affection
and with pity. 'But, sister, understand rightly: 'tis no child's play
of hide and seek. 'Tis life or death!&mdash;life or death! If we fly, we
must never come back again! Understand that well.'</p>

<p>'Since we are in the Lord's hands, brother, why should we
fear? Take me with you; let me die, if you must die; and if
you live I am content to live with you, so that my husband never
find me out.'</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XLIV.</h2>

<h3>A SCARE.</h3>


<div class="drop">
<img src="images/i_321.jpg" alt="T" width="100" height="100" class="cap" />
 <p class="cap_1">There is between the condition of the mind and that
of the body an interdependence which cannot but be
recognised by every physician. So greatly has this
connection affected some of the modern physicians, as
to cause doubts in their minds whether there be any
life at all hereafter, or if, when the pulse ceases to beat, the whole
man should become a dead and senseless lump of clay. In this,
they confuse the immortal soul with the perishable instruments of
brain and body, through which in life it manifests its being and
betrays its true nature, whether of good or ill.</p>
</div>

<p>Thus, the condition in which Robin now lay clearly corresponded,
as I now understand, with the state of his mind induced by the
news that Alice, to save his life, had been betrayed into marrying
his cousin. For at the hearing of that dreadful news he was seized
with such a transport of rage (not against that poor innocent victim,
but against his cousin) as threatened to throw him into madness;
and on recovering from this access, he presently fell into a kind of
despair, in which he languished during the whole voyage. So also
in a corresponding manner, after a fever, the violence of which was
like to have torn him to pieces, he fell into a lethargy, in which,
though his fever left him, he continued to wander in his mind, and
grew, as I could not fail to mark, daily weaker in his body, refusing
to eat, though Alice brought him dainty broth of chicken, delicate
panadas of bread and butter, fruit boiled with sugar, and other
things fit to tempt a sick man's appetite, provided by the goodness
of Madam. This lady was in religion a Romanist; by birth she
was a Spanish Quadroon. To escape the slavery to which the colour
of her grandmother doomed her, she escaped from Cuba and found
her way to Jamaica, where she met with our master. And whether
she was lawfully married unto him I will not, after her kindness to
Alice and her faithfulness to myself as regards Robin, so much as ask.</p>

<p>Robin, therefore, though the fever left him, did not mend. On
the contrary, as I have said, he grew daily weaker; so that I marvelled
at his lasting so long, and looked to see him die, as so many
die, in the early morning, when there is a sharpness or eagerness in
the air, and the body is exhausted by long sleep. Yet he died not.</p>

<p>And now you shall hear how, through the Duke of Monmouth's
ring, we escaped from our servitude. 'God grant,' said the Duke,
'that it bring thee good luck!' This was a light and unconsidered
prayer, forgotten as soon as uttered, meant only to please the ear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
of a child. And yet, in a manner most marvellous to consider, it
proved the salvation of us all. What better luck could that ring
cause than that we should escape from the land of Egypt&mdash;the
House of Bondage?</p>

<p>'I have disposed of the ring,' Barnaby told me a few days later.
'That is to say, John Nuthall has secretly pledged it with a merchant
for twenty guineas. He said that the ring belongs to a
convict; but many of them have brought such precious things with
them in order to buy their freedom. He owns that the stones are
fine, and very willingly gave the money on their security.'</p>

<p>'Then nothing remains,' I said, 'but to get away.'</p>

<p>'John Nuthall has bought provisions and all we want, little by
little, so as to excite no suspicion. They are secretly and safely
bestowed, and half the money still remains in his hands. How
goes Robin?'</p>

<p>'He draws daily nearer to his grave. We cannot depart until
either he mends or dies. 'Tis another disaster, Barnaby.'</p>

<p>'Ay; but of disaster we must not think. Robin will die. Yet our
own case may be as bad if it comes to scuttling the ship. Cheer up,
lads; many men die, but the world goes on. Poor Robin! Every
man for himself and the Lord for us all. Sis will cry; but even if
Robin recovers he cannot marry her: a consideration which ought to
comfort her. And for him&mdash;since nothing else will serve him&mdash;it is
best that he should die. Better make an end at once than go all
his life with hanging head for the sake of a woman, as if there are
not plenty women in the world to serve his turn.'</p>

<p>'I know not what ails him that he does not get better. The air
is too hot for him; he hath lost his appetite. Barnaby,' I cried,
moved to a sudden passion of pity such as would often seize me at
that time, 'saw one ever ruin more complete than ours? Had we
been fighting for Spain and the accursed Inquisition we could not
have been more heavily punished. And we were fighting on the
Lord's side!'</p>

<p>'We were&mdash;Dad was with us too. And see how he was served!
The Lord, it seems, doth not provide His servants with arms, or
with ammunition, or with commanders. Otherwise, the Duke this
day would be in St. James's Palace wearing his father's crown, and
you would be a Court physician with a great wig and a velvet coat,
instead of a Monmouth cap and a canvas shirt. And I should be
an admiral. But what doth it profit to ask why and wherefore?
Let us first get clear of the wreck. Well; I wish we were to take
Robin with us. 'Twill be a poor business going back to Bradford
Orcas without him.'</p>

<p>We waited, therefore, day after day, for Robin either to get
better or to die, and still he lingered, seemingly in a waste or decline,
but such as I had never before seen; and I know not what
would have happened to him, whether he would have lived or died,
but then there happened a thing which caused us to wait no longer.
It was this.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span></p>

<p>The master having, according to his daily custom, gone the
round of his estate&mdash;that is to say, having seen his servants all at
work under their drivers; some planting with the hoe, some weeding,
some cutting the maize, some gathering yams, potatoes, cassavy,
or bonavist for provisions, some attending the ingenio or the
still-house&mdash;did unluckily take into his head to visit the sick-house.
What was more unfortunate, this desire came upon him after he
had taken a morning dram, and that of the stiffest: not, indeed,
enough to make him drunk, but enough to make him obstinate and
wilful. When I saw him standing at the open door, I perceived
by the glassiness of his eyes and the unsteadiness of his shoulders
that he had already begun the day's debauch. He was now in a
most dangerous condition of mind. Later in the day, when he was
more advanced in drink, he might be violent, but he would be
much less dangerous, because he would afterwards forget what he
had said or done in his cups.</p>

<p>'So, Sir Doctor,' he said, 'I have truly a profitable pair of
servants!&mdash;one who pretends to cure everybody, and so escapes
work; and your cousin, who pretends to be sick, and so will do
none! A mighty bargain I made, truly, when I bought you
both!'</p>

<p>'With submission, sir,' I said, 'I have within the last week
earned for your honour ten guineas' worth of fees.'</p>

<p>'Well, that is as it may be. How do I know what hath gone
into your own pocket? Where is this malingering fellow? Make
him sit up! Sit up, I say, ye skulking dog; sit up!'</p>

<p>'Sir,' I said, still speaking with the greatest humility, 'nobody
but the Lord can make this man sit up.' And, indeed, Robin did
not comprehend one word that was said.</p>

<p>'I gave fifty pounds for him only a month ago. Am I to lose
all that money, I ask? Fifty pounds! because I was told that he
was a gentleman and would be ransomed by his family. Hark ye,
Doctor, you must either cure this man for me&mdash;or else, by the
Lord! you shall have his ransom added to your own. If he dies,
I will double your price! Mark that!'</p>

<p>I said nothing, hoping that he would depart. As for Alice, she
had turned her back upon him at his first appearance (as Madam
had ordered her to do), so that he might not notice her.</p>

<p>Unfortunately he did not depart, but came into the room, looking
about him. Certainly he was not one who would suffer his
servants to be negligent, even in the smallest things.</p>

<p>'Here is fine work!' he said. 'Sheets of the best&mdash;a pillow;
what hath a servant to do with such luxuries?'</p>

<p>'My cousin is a gentleman,' I told him, 'and accustomed to lie
in linen. The rug which is enough for him in health must have a
sheet to it as well, now that he is sick.'</p>

<p>'Humph! And whom have we here! Who art thou, madam,
I wish to know?'</p>

<p>Alice turned.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span></p>

<p>'I am your honour's servant,' she said. 'I am employed in
this sick-house when I am not in the sewing-room.'</p>

<p>'A servant? Oh! madam, I humbly crave your pardon. I
took you for some fine lady. I am honoured by having such a
servant. All the rest of my women servants go in plain smock and
petticoat. But,' here he smiled, 'to so lovely a girl as Alice
Eykin&mdash;fair Alice, sweet Alice&mdash;we must give the bravest and
daintiest. To thee, my dear, nothing can be denied. Those dainty
cheeks, those white hands, were never made to adorn a common
coif. Mistress Alice, we must be better acquainted. This is no
fit place for you. Not the sick-house, but the best room in my
house shall be at thy service.'</p>

<p>'Sir, I ask for nothing but to sit retired, and to render such
service as is in my power.'</p>

<p>'To sit retired? Why, that cannot be longer suffered. 'Twould
be a sin to keep hidden any longer this treasure&mdash;this marvel, I
say, of beauty and grace. My servant! Nay; 'tis I&mdash;'tis the
whole island&mdash;who are thy servants. Thou to render service!
'Tis for me, madam, to render service to thy beauty.' He took off
his hat and flourished it, making a leg.</p>

<p>'Then, sir,' said Alice, 'suffer me, I pray, to go about my
business, which is with this sick man, and not to hear compliments.'</p>

<p>He caught her hand and would have kissed it, but she drew it
back.</p>

<p>'Nay, coy damsel,' he said; 'I swear I will not go without a
kiss from thy lips! Kiss me, my dear.'</p>

<p>She started back, and I rushed between them. At that moment
Madam herself appeared.</p>

<p>'What do you here?' she cried, catching his arm. 'What has
this girl to do with you? Come away! Come away, and leave her
in peace!'</p>

<p>'Go back to the house, woman!' he roared, breaking from her
and flourishing his stick, so that I thought he was actually going to
cudgel her. 'Go back, or it will be the worse for you. What?
Am I master here or you? Go back, I say.'</p>

<p>Then a strange thing happened. She made no reply, but she
turned upon him eyes so full of authority that she looked like a
queen. He shifted his feet, made as if he would speak, and finally
obeyed, and went out of the place to his own house with the
greatest meekness, soberness, and quietness.</p>

<p>Presently Madam came back.</p>

<p>'I blame thee not, child,' she said. 'It is with him as I have
told thee. When he begins to drink the Devil enters into him.
Dost think he came here to see the sick man? No, but for thy
fair eyes, inflamed with love as well as with drink. At such times
no one can rule him but myself, and even I may fail. Keep snug,
therefore. Perhaps he may forget thee again. But, indeed, I
know not.'</p>

<p>She sighed, and left us.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XLV.</h2>

<h3>BARNABY THE AVENGER.</h3>


<div class="drop">
<img src="images/i_325.jpg" alt="T" width="100" height="100" class="cap" />
 <p class="cap_1">The man did not come back. During the whole day I
remained with Alice in fear. But he molested us not.</p>
</div>

<p>When the sun set, and the field hands returned, I
was in two minds whether to tell Barnaby what had
happened, or not. But when I saw his honest face,
streaked with the dust of the day's work, and watched him eating
his lump of salt beef and basin of yellow porridge with as much
satisfaction as if it had been a banquet of all the dainties, I could
not bear, without greater cause, to disturb his mind.</p>

<p>'To-night,' he told me, when there was no more beef and the
porridge was all eaten, 'there is a great feast at the Bridge. I
would we had some of their Sherris and Madeira. The Governor
of Nevis landed yesterday, and is entertained to-day by our Governor.
All the militia are feasting, officers and men; nobody will
be on the look-out anywhere; and it is a dark night, with no
moon. What a chance for us, could we make our escape to-night!
There may never again happen such a chance for us! How goes
Robin?'</p>

<p>And so after a little more talk we lay down in our hammocks,
and I, for one, fell instantly asleep, having no fear at all for Alice;
first, because the Master would be now at the Bridge, feasting and
too drunk for anything but to sleep; and next, because she had
with her the woman Deb, as stout and lusty as any man.</p>

<p>The Master was not at the Bridge with the rest of the planters
and gentlemen. Perhaps the drink which he took in the morning
caused him to forget the great banquet. However that may be, he
was, most unluckily for himself, drinking at home and alone, yet
dressed in his best coat and wig, and with his sword, all of which
he had put on for the Governor's banquet.</p>

<p>After a while the Devil entered into him, finding easy admission,
so to speak, all doors thrown wide open, and even a welcome
in that deboshed and profligate soul. About eight o'clock, therefore,
prompted by the Evil One, the Master rose and stealthily
crept out of the house.</p>

<p>It was a dark night, but he needed no light to guide his footsteps.
He crossed the court and made straight for the sick-house.</p>

<p>He pushed the door open and stood for a little, looking within.
By the light of the horn lanthorn he saw the girl whose image was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
in his mind. The sight might have caused him to return, repentant
and ashamed. For she was on her knees, praying aloud beside the
bedside of the sick man.</p>

<p>As he stood in the door the woman named Deb, who lay upon
the floor asleep, woke up and raised her head. But he saw her not.
Then she sat up, watching him with suspicion. But his eyes were
fixed on the figure of Alice. Then she sprang to her feet, for now
she knew that mischief was meant, and she stood in readiness,
prepared with her great strong arms to defend her mistress. But
he thought nobody was in the house but Alice and the sick man.
He saw nothing but the girl at the bedside.</p>

<p>I say that I was sleeping. I was awakened at the sound of a
shriek&mdash;I knew the voice&mdash;I sprang from the hammock.</p>

<p>'God of mercy!' I cried, 'it is Alice! Barnaby, awake!&mdash;awake,
I say! It is the cry of Alice!'</p>

<p>Then I rushed to the sick-house.</p>

<p>There I saw Alice&mdash;shrieking and crying for help. And before
her the Master struggling and wrestling with the woman Deb. She
had her arms round his neck and made as if she was trying to
throttle him. Nay, I think that she would have throttled him, so
strong she was and possessed of such a spirit, and by the light of the
lanthorn gleaming upon the blade I saw that his sword had either
fallen from his hand or from the scabbard, and now lay upon the floor.</p>

<p>'Stand back,' cried Barnaby, pushing me aside. 'Leave go of
him, woman. Let me deal with him.'</p>

<p>The thing was done in a moment. Merciful Heavens! To think
that thus suddenly should the soul of man be called to its account!
I had seen the poor fellows shot down and cut to pieces on Sedgemoor;
but then they knew that they were going forth to fight, and
so might be killed. There was time before the battle for a prayer.
But this man had no time&mdash;and he was more than half drunk as
well.</p>

<p>He lay at our feet, lifeless, Barnaby standing over him with a
broken sword in his hand.</p>

<p>For a while no one spoke or moved. But the woman called
Deb gasped and panted and even laughed, as one who is well pleased
because she hath had her revenge.</p>

<p>Then Madam herself, clad in a long white night-dress and with
bare feet, suddenly pushed us aside and fell upon her knees beside
the wounded man.</p>

<p>She lifted his head. The face was pale and the eyes closed.
She laid it gently down and looked round.</p>

<p>'You have killed him,' she said, speaking not in a rage or
passion, but quietly. 'You have killed him. To-morrow you will
hang! you will all hang!'</p>

<p>We said nothing.</p>

<p>'Doctor,' she turned to me, 'tell me if he is dead or living.'</p>

<p>She snatched the lanthorn and held it while I made such
examination as was possible. I opened his waistcoat and laid back<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
his shirt. The sword had run straight through him and broken off
short, perhaps by contact with his ribs. The broken point remained
in the wound and the flesh had closed around it, so that, save for a
drop of blood or two oozing out, there was no flow.</p>

<p>It needs no great knowledge to understand that when a man
hath six inches of steel in his body which cannot be pulled out,
and when he is bleeding inwardly, he must die.</p>

<p>Still, as physicians use, I did not tell her so.</p>

<p>'Madam,' I said, 'he is not dead; he is living. While there
is life, there is hope.'</p>

<p>'Oh!' she cried; 'why did he buy you when he could have
had the common sort? You will hang&mdash;you will hang, every one!'</p>

<p>'That shall we presently discover,' said Barnaby. 'Humphrey,
we have now no choice left&mdash;what did I tell thee about the chances
of the night? We must go this night. As for this villain, let him
bleed to death.'</p>

<p>'Go!' said Madam. 'Whither, unhappy men, will you go?
There is no place in the island where you can hide but with bloodhounds
they will have you out. You can go nowhere in this island
but you will be found and hanged, unless you are shot like rats in
a hole.'</p>

<p>'Come, Humphrey,' said Barnaby, 'we will carry Robin. This
poor woman must go too; she will else be hanged for trying to
throttle him. Well, she can lend a hand to carry Robin. Madam,
by your leave we will not hang, nor will we be shot. In the&mdash;in the&mdash;the
cave&mdash;cave that I know of, your bloodhounds will never find us.'</p>

<p>'Madam,' I said, 'it is true that we shall attempt to escape.
For what hath happened I am truly sorry; yet we may not suffer
such a thing as was this night attempted without resistance, else
should we be worse than the ignorant blacks. The Master will
perhaps live, and not die. Listen, and take heed therefore.'</p>

<p>'Doctor,' she said, 'do not leave me. Stay with me, or he will
die. Doctor, stay with me, and I will save your life. I will swear
that you came at my call. Stay with me&mdash;I will save Alice as well.
I will save you both. You shall be neither flogged nor hanged.
I swear it. I will say that I called you for help when it was too
late. Only this man and this woman shall hang. Who are they?
A rogue and&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>Barnaby laughed aloud.</p>

<p>'Doctor,' she said, 'if you stay he will perhaps recover and
forgive you all.'</p>

<p>Barnaby laughed again.</p>

<p>'Madam,' I told her, 'better death upon the gallows than any
further term of life with such a man.'</p>

<p>'Oh!' she cried; 'he will die where he is lying!'</p>

<p>'That may be, I know not.' I gave her certain directions,
bidding her, above all, watch the man, and cause him to lie perfectly
quiet and not to speak a word, even in a whisper, and to
give him a few drops of cordial from time to time.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span></p>

<p>'Come,' said Barnaby, 'we lose time, which is precious.
Madam, if your husband recover&mdash;and for my part I care nothing
whether he recover or whether he die&mdash;but if he should recover,
tell him from me, Captain Barnaby Eykin, that I shall very likely
return to this island, and that I shall then, the Lord helping, kill
him in fair duello, to wipe out the lash of the cudgel which he was
good enough once to lay about my head. If he dies of this trifling
thrust with his own sword he must lay that to the account of my
sister. Enough,' said Barnaby, 'we will now make our way to the
woods and the cave.'</p>

<p>This said, Barnaby went to the head of Robin's bed and
ordered Deb to take the foot, and so between them they carried
him forth with them, while Alice followed and I went last.</p>

<p>We heard, long afterwards, through one Mr. Anstiss&mdash;the same
young gentleman who loved Alice and would have married her&mdash;what
had happened when we were gone. An hour or thereabouts
afterwards, Madam woke up one of the overseers, telling him what
had happened, and bidding him be ready at daybreak, with the
bloodhounds, horses, and loaded guns, to follow in pursuit and
bring us back.</p>

<p>There would be, they thought, no difficulty at all in catching
us, because we were encumbered by a sick man and two women.</p>

<p>There was, however, more difficulty than they expected. For
the footsteps led the bloodhounds to the seashore; and here the
trace was lost, nor could it ever be afterwards recovered. And
though the hue and cry was out over all the island, and the woods and
the ravines and caves where runaway negroes hide were searched,
we were never found. Therefore, since no boat at all was missing
(the Guineaman had sailed away), it was certain that we could not
have escaped by sea. It was fortunate, indeed, that Barnaby
dropped no hint about the sea; otherwise there would have been
despatched some of the boats of the port in search of us, and in
that case the scuttling of the ship might have been necessary.
For, had we been caught, we should certainly have been hanged
for murder, after being flogged for attempted escape. For the
Master died. He lay speechless until the day broke. Then he
became conscious, and presently breathed his last in great anguish
of body and terror of mind. What hath since become of Madam,
and of that miserable family of servants and slaves, I know not.
Certain it is that they could not find a more barbarous or a more
savage master in place of him whom Barnaby slew if they were to
search the whole of the Spanish Main and the islands upon it.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XLVI.</h2>

<h3>A PERILOUS VOYAGE.</h3>


<div class="drop">
<img src="images/i_329.jpg" alt="I" width="100" height="99" class="cap" />
 <p class="cap_1">I n this way, unexpected and tragical, arrived our chance
of escape. We walked to Carlisle Bay by way of the
sea-shore, so that we might be met by none, and in
order that the bloodhounds (if they should use them)
in the morning might be thrown off the track. On
the march that stout and lusty wench who carried one end of the
bed neither called for a halt nor complained of the burden she
carried all the way. It was nigh unto midnight when we arrived
at the creek in which the boat lay sunk. This was within a stone's
throw of John Nuthall's cottage, where were bestowed the mast,
sails, oars, and gear, with such provisions as he had gotten together
for the voyage. The man was sleeping when Barnaby called him,
but he quickly got up, and in less than an hour we had the boat
hauled out of the water, the provisions hastily thrown in, the mast
stepped, our sick man and the women placed in the bows, the
stern and middle of the boat being encumbered with our provisions,
we had pushed down the muddy and stinking creek, we had hoisted
sail, and we were stealing silently out of Carlisle Bay under
a light breeze. Three or four ships were lying in the bay; but
either there was no watch kept aboard, or (which is more probable)
it was no one's business to hail a small sail-boat going out, probably
for fishing at dawn. Besides, the night was so dark that we may
very well have escaped notice. However that might be, in a
quarter of an hour we were well out at sea, beyond the reach of
the guns of Carlisle Bay, no longer visible to the ships in port, and
without any fear of being seen until daybreak. The wind, which
sometimes drops altogether in the night, still continued favourable,
though very light.</p>
</div>

<p>'My lads,' said Barnaby presently, drawing a long breath, 'I
verily believe that we have given them the slip this time. In the
morning they may go forth, if they please, with their bloodhounds
to hunt for us. Let them hunt. If any inquiry is made for us at
the Bridge, no boat will be missing, and so no suspicion will be
awakened. They will then, I suppose, search for us among the
caves and ravines of which I have heard, where there are hiding-places
in plenty, but no water to drink, so that the poor devils who
run away and seek a refuge there are speedily forced to come out
for water, and so are caught or shot down. Well, they will hunt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
a long time before they find us. This boat makes a little water,
but I think not much. If she proves watertight, and the breeze
holds, by daylight we should be well to the south of the island.
Courage, therefore! All will be well yet! How goes Robin?'</p>

<p>He was lying as easily as we could manage for him&mdash;one rug
over him and another under him. Alice sat on one side of him,
and the woman they called Deb on the other. Then, because
the boat sometimes shipped a little water when she dipped in the
waves, Barnaby rigged a tarpaulin round the bows to prevent this;
and (but this was not till next day) over the tarpaulin he made, out
of a rug and a spare spar, a low tilt which, unless the weather grew
bad, should shelter those three by night from dew and spray, and
by day from the sun overhead and the glare and heat of the
water.</p>

<p>'Deb,' he said softly, 'art afraid?'</p>

<p>'No, sir&mdash;not while my mistress is here.' (Meaning Alice.)</p>

<p>'If we are taken, we shall all be flogged well nigh unto death,
and very likely hanged as well.'</p>

<p>'I am not afraid, sir.'</p>

<p>'We may spring a leak,' said Barnaby, 'and so go all to the
bottom and be devoured. Art not afraid to die?'</p>

<p>'No, sir&mdash;not if I may hold my mistress by the hand, so that
she may take me whither she goeth herself.'</p>

<p>'Good,' said Barnaby. 'As for me, I expect I shall have to go
alone or with John Nuthall here. Well, there will be a goodly
company of us. Go to sleep, my girl! In the morning we will
serve around the first ration, with perhaps, if all be well, a dram
of cordial.'</p>

<p>In the dim light of the stars I watched all night the three figures
in the bow. Robin lay white and motionless; Alice sat, covered
with her hood, bending over him; and Deb, from whose head her
coif had fallen, lay, head on arm, sound asleep. She had no fear,
any more than a common soldier has when he goes into action, because
he trusts his captain.</p>

<p>Thus began our voyage: in an open boat twenty feet long, with
a company of three sound men, two women, and a sick man. For
arms, in case we needed them, we had none at all. If any ship
crossed our track and should call upon us to surrender we could
not deny that we were escaped convicts, because the dress of all
but one proclaimed the fact. Who, in such a climate, would choose
to wear a coarse shirt and canvas breeches, with a Monmouth cap,
except it was a servant or a slave who had no choice, but must
take what is given him?</p>

<p>But we should not surrender, come what might. If we could
neither fight nor fly, we could sink. Said Barnaby, in the dead of
night, whispering in my ear, 'Lad, 'tis agreed between us, we will
have that clear; sooner than be taken, we will scuttle the ship,
and so sink all together. If 'tis accounted murder, the blame shall
lie between us.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span></p>

<p>A little before daybreak the breeze freshened, and the waves
began to rise; but not so high as to threaten the boat, which
proved, indeed, a most gallant little craft, dancing over the waters
as if she enjoyed being driven by the breeze. Some boats, as
sailors will tell you (being always apt to compare these craft with
living creatures), come thus, frolic and sprightly, from their makers'
hands; while others, built of the same material and on the same
lines, are, on the contrary, and always remain, heavy and lumpish;
just as some children are lively and gay, while others, born of the
same parents, are dull and morose.</p>

<p>Then the sun rose, seeming to leap out of the water, a most
glorious ball of fire, which instantly warmed the cool air and began
to burn and scorch our hands and faces. In these hot latitudes
one understands what the ancients meant when they spoke of the
dreadful Sun-God, who both gives and destroys life, and is so
beneficial and yet so terrible. We, who live in a cold country, are
sometimes greatly comforted by the sun, but are never burned;
we feel his warmth, but understand not his power.</p>

<p>Then Barnaby began to gaze curiously all round the horizon.
We had no glass or telescope; but his eyes were to him as good as
any telescope is to most men.</p>

<p>'Thank the Lord!' he said, drawing breath (it was rare for
Barnaby thus openly to give praise), 'there is no sail in sight.
To be sure, we have the day before us. But yet'&mdash;here he began
to talk as some men use when they desire to place before their own
minds clearly the position of affairs. 'Very well, then&mdash;Barbadoes
laying thirty miles and more nor'-east by north&mdash;vessels
bound for the island from Bristol commonly sailing round the
north&mdash;very well, then&mdash;we are out of their track. Yet&mdash;then
again&mdash;some are driven south by stress of weather. Ay, there is
our danger. Yet again, if one should see us, would she bear down
upon us? I greatly doubt it. The wind will continue&mdash;that is
pretty sure. If they were to discover that we had gone by boat,
would they sail after us? Why, what boat could they send? And
whither would they steer? And what boat have they that can sail
faster than this little craft? Yet we are pretty low down in the
water. Humphrey, lad'&mdash;he turned upon me his broad and sunburnt
face, full of cheerfulness&mdash;'we are not within many hours of
scuttling yet. A tight boat, a fair wind, a smooth sea&mdash;let us hope
for the best! How goes Robin?'</p>

<p>There was no change in Robin, either for better or for worse.</p>

<p>'Sis,' said Barnaby; 'art sleeping still, Sis? Wake up, and
let us eat and drink, and be jolly! What! Alice, I say! Why&mdash;we
have escaped! We are far away at sea! Let us laugh and
sing. If there were room in this cockle, I would dance also!'</p>

<p>She lifted her head, and threw back her hood. Ah! what a
mournful face was there!</p>

<p>'Oh, brother!' she said, 'canst thou laugh and sing? Hast
thou forgotten last night?'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span></p>

<p>'Why, no,' he replied. 'One must not forget last night, because
it was the night of our escape. All else, I own, I can forget.
Let it not stick in thy gizzard, my dear, that the man frightened
thee. Rejoice rather that he thus afforded me a chance of giving
him a taste of his own cold iron.'</p>

<p>'Nay, brother,' she said, shaking her head; then she looked
round her. 'We are a long way from the land,' she said. 'When
will they send out a ship to bring us back?'</p>

<p>'Why, d'ye see,' Barnaby replied, 'give us twelve hours more,
and they may send out all their fleet, if they have one, and sail the
wide world round for us, and yet not capture us. And now let us
overhaul the provisions, and examine the ship's stores.' Alice pulled
her hood down again, and said no more. The woman they called
Deb was now wide awake, and staring about her with the greatest
satisfaction.</p>

<p>'Come, John Nuthall,' Barnaby went on, 'we are hungry and
thirsty. Where is the list I made for thee? Thou art our purser,
our supercargo, our cook, and our steward; thou art also bo's'n
and carpenter, and half the crew. Where is my list, I say? Give
it me, and we will examine our stores. Look up, Sis; never cry
over what is done and over. What? A villain hath received a
lesson, and thou hangest thy head therefor? Look up, I say. There
is now hope for all; thou shalt merrily dance at my wedding yet.'</p>

<p>Then he read the list, and examined each parcel or box with
great care.</p>

<p>'A hundred and a half of bread, a soft cheese, plantains, a keg
of water (nine gallons), six bottles of Canary (not one broken), a
compass, a half-hour glass, a spare rug ('tis over Robin's legs),
flint and steel, a bit of tarpaulin, a hatchet and hammer, a saw,
some nails, a spar or two, a coil of rope and yarn, a lump of tobacco
(we can chew it, though I would rather put it into a pipe),
candles&mdash;faugh! they are run together in a lump; they will serve
to caulk something presently.'</p>

<p>We had, in fact, no light during our voyage, but the tallow
proved useful when&mdash;I think it was the next day&mdash;the boat started
a leak.</p>

<p>This was all our store. 'Twas not much for six people, but
Barnaby hoped that the voyage would be short. If he should be
disappointed, who would not put up with short rations for a day or
two for the sake of freedom?</p>

<p>'And now,' he said, when everything was stowed according to
his mind, 'we will have breakfast. Our provisions are no great
things; but, after the accursed loblollie, a bit of bread and cheese
will be a feast.'</p>

<p>A feast indeed it was, and our captain gratified us further by
opening a flask of Canary, which raised all our hearts. Strange that
men should be able to recover their spirits, which should be independent
of the creature comforts, by a dram of wine. As for
Barnaby, I thought he would have kissed the bottle.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span></p>

<p>'It is now three months and more,' he said, 'that we have had
nothing save a sup of kill-devil fresh from the still, and now we
are mercifully permitted to taste again a glass of Canary. 'Tis too
much!' he sighed, drinking his ration. 'Well, we have but a few
bottles, and the voyage may be longer than we hope; therefore we
must go upon short allowance. But fear not, Sis; there shall
always be enough for Robin, poor lad.'</p>

<p>He then proceeded to tell us what he intended, and whither he
would steer.</p>

<p>'We have no chart,' he said. 'What then? I can draw one as
good as they are made to steer by in these seas.' He could not draw
one, because he had no paper or pencil; but he carved one with the
point of his knife on the seat, and marked out our course upon it day
by day. 'See,' he said, 'here is Barbadoes. Our course all night hath
been sou'-west. She now makes five knots an hour. It is now eight, I
take it; and we must therefore be about forty miles from Barbadoes.
To-morrow morning we should make the Grenadilloes, which are a
hundred and fifty miles from Carlisle Bay. Hark ye! There may
be a Bristol vessel sailing from Great Grenada to Barbadoes, or
the other way. That would be the devil. But such ships are rare,
and there is no trade between the two islands. Well, we shall give
Grenada as wide a berth as may be.' Here he considered a little.
'Therefore, 'twill be our wiser plan to bear more to the south.
Once south of Grenada, I take it, there will be no more danger.
Off the main of South America the sea is covered with islands.
They are No Man's Land; inhabitants have they none; navigators,
for the most part, know them not; English, French, and Spanish
ships come never to these islands. My purpose, therefore, is to put
in at Great Margaritos or Tortuga for rest and fresh water, and so
presently make the Dutch island of CuraÃ§ao.'</p>

<p>'And after that?'</p>

<p>'Then, my lad, we shall take ship to some country where a
sailor may get a berth and a physician may find patients. It must
be to Holland first; but, never fear, we shall get back to England
some time; and perhaps fight another battle with a different tale
to tell afterwards.'</p>

<p>As the day advanced, the coast of Barbadoes continually receded,
until, before sunset, the island lay like a purple cloud low down in
the horizon. The north-east breeze blew steadily, but the sun
caused a most dreadful heat in the air, and our eyes smarted from
the glare of the water and the spray that was blown upon us. It
was at this time that Barnaby constructed the tilt of which I have
spoken. The sea lay spread out round us in a broad circle, of
which we were the centre, and the cloudless blue sky lay over us
like unto a roof laid there for us alone. It is only in a ship one doth
feel thus alone, in the centre of creation; even as if there were
nothing but the sea around, the sky above, and our boat in the
centre. Thus must the Patriarch Noah have felt when his ark
floated upon the vast face of the water, and even the tops of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
high hills were hidden and covered over. All day Barnaby scanned
the horizon anxiously; but there came into sight no sail or ship
whatever. To us, who sometimes see the vessels lying in a crowded
port, and hear how they bring argosies from every land, it seems
as if every part of the ocean must be covered with sails driving
before the wind from whatever quarter it may blow. But he who
considers the 'Mappa Mundi' will presently discover that there are
vast expanses of sea where never a sail is seen, unless it be the
fugitive sail of the pirate or the bark canoe of the native. We
were now nearing such a lonely sea or part of the ocean. Barnaby
knew, what these planters did not, how to steer across the unknown
water to a port of safety beyond.</p>

<p>At midday our captain served out another drink of water, and
to Robin I gave a sop of bread in Canary, which he seemed to suck
up and to swallow with readiness.</p>

<p>In such a voyage, where there is nothing to do but to keep the
ship on her course and to watch the horizon for a strange sail, one
speedily falls into silence, and sits many hours without speech;
sometimes falling asleep, lulled by the ripple of the water as the
boat flies through it.</p>

<p>I have said nothing about the man John Nuthall. He was
a plain, honest-looking man, and we found him throughout all
this business faithful, brave, and patient, obedient to Barnaby,
and of an even temper and contented with his share. That he
had formerly been a thief in his native country cannot be
denied, but I hope that we shall not refuse to any man the right of
repentance.</p>

<p>Barnaby divided the crew&mdash;namely, himself, John Nuthall,
and me&mdash;into three watches of eight hours each, of which each man
kept two at a stretch. Thus, beginning the day at noon, which was
the only time we knew for certain, Barnaby would himself (but this
was after the first two days) lie down and sleep till sunset or a
little later. Then John Nuthall lay down and took his turn of
sleep till Barnaby thought it was two o'clock in the morning, when
he woke him and I took his place. But for the first day or two
Barnaby slept not at all, and the whole of the voyage he slept as a
good watch-dog sleeps&mdash;namely, with one eye open.</p>

<p>At sunset he gave out another pannikin of cold water to each of
us, a ration of bread and cheese, and a dram of wine. Then he
commanded John Nuthall to lie down and sleep, while I took the
tiller and he himself held the ropes. Then the night fell once
more upon us.</p>

<p>Presently, while we sat there in silence, Alice rose up from her
seat and came aft and sat down beside me.</p>

<p>'Humphrey,' she whispered, 'think you that he is truly dead?'
She was speaking, not of Robin, but of the Master.</p>

<p>'I know not, my dear.'</p>

<p>'I can think of nothing but of that man's sudden end, and of
what may happen to us. Say something to comfort me, Humphrey!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
You always had some good word to say, like manna for refreshment.
My soul is low in the dust&mdash;I cannot even pray.'</p>

<p>'Why, my dear?' What could I say? ''Tis true that the man
was struck down, and that suddenly. And yet&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'To think that my brother&mdash;that Barnaby&mdash;should have killed
him!'</p>

<p>'Why,' said Barnaby, 'if some one had to kill him, why not I
as well as another? What odds who killed him?'</p>

<p>'Oh!' she said, 'that a man should be called away at such a
moment, when his brain was reeling with wine and wicked
thoughts!'</p>

<p>'He was not dead,' I told her (though I knew very well what
would be the end), 'when we came away. Many a man recovers
who hath had a sword-thrust through the body. He may now be
on the mend&mdash;who can tell?' Yet I knew, I say, very well how
it must have ended. 'Consider, my dear: he tempted the wrath
of God, if any man ever did. If he is destroyed, on his own head
be it&mdash;not on ours. If he recover, he will have had a lesson which
will serve him for the rest of his life. If he doth not recover, he
may have time left him for something of repentance and of
prayer. Why, Alice, if we get safely to our port we ought to consider
the punishment of this sinner (which was in self-defence, as
one may truly say) the very means granted by Providence for our
own escape. How else should we have got away? How else
should we have resolved to venture all, even to carrying Robin
with us?' All this, I repeat, I said to encourage her, because, if
I know aught of wounds, a man bleeding inwardly of a sword-thrust
through his vitals would have short time for the collecting
of his thoughts or the repentance of his sins, being as truly cut off
in the midst of them as if he had been struck down by a thunderbolt.
A man may groan and writhe under the dreadful torture of such a
wound, but there is little room for meditation or for repentance.</p>

<p>Then I asked her if she was in fear as to the event of the
voyage.</p>

<p>'I fear nothing,' she told me, 'but to be captured and taken
back to the place whence we came, there to be put in prison and
flogged. That is my only fear. Humphrey, we have suffered so
much that this last shame would be too great for me to bear. Oh!
to be tied up before all the men, and flogged like the black women&mdash;'twould
kill me, Humphrey!'</p>

<p>'Alice,' I said very earnestly, 'art thou, indeed, brave enough
to endure death itself rather than this last barbarity?'</p>

<p>'Oh! Death!&mdash;death!' she cried, clasping her hands. 'What
is death to me, who have lost everything?'</p>

<p>'Nay, but consider, my dear. To die at sea&mdash;it means to sink
down under the cold water out of the light of day; to be choked
for want of air; perhaps to be devoured quick by sharks; to lie
at the bottom of the water, the seaweed growing over your bones;
to be rolled about by the troubled waves&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span></p>

<p>'Humphrey, these are old wives' tales. Why, if it had been
lawful I would have killed myself long ago. But I must not lose
heaven as well as earth. A brief pang it is to die, and then to be
happy for ever. What do I care whether the seaweed covers my
bones, or the cold clay? Oh, Humphrey, Humphrey, why should I
care any longer to live?'</p>

<p>'My dear,' I said, 'if we escape in safety there may yet be
happiness in store. No man knoweth the future.' She shook her
head. 'Happiness,' I told her, 'doth not commonly come to man
in the way which he most desires and prays. For, if he doth
obtain the thing for which he hath so ardently prayed, he presently
finds that the thing bringeth not the joy he so much expected. Or
it comes too late, as is the case often with honours and wealth,
when one foot is already in the grave. I mean, my dear, that we
must not despair because the thing which most we desired is taken
from us. Perhaps we ought not to desire anything at all, except
what the Lord shall provide. But that is a hard saying, and if
men desired nothing it is certain they would no longer work.'
I talked thus at length to divert her mind from her troubles.
'To thee, poor child,' I said, 'have been given afflictions many
and great&mdash;the loss of godly parents, a husband whom thou must
avoid, and the deprivation of earthly love. Yet, since thou art so
brave, Alice, I will tell thee&mdash;I thought not to tell thee anything
of this&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'What, Humphrey? What?'</p>

<p>'Briefly, Alice, thou shalt not be taken alive.'</p>

<p>'How&mdash;unless you kill me?'</p>

<p>'We are agreed, my dear&mdash;Barnaby and I&mdash;that if we cannot
escape any boats which may pursue us the boat shall be sunk, and
so we shall all drown together. Indeed, Alice, I confess that I am
not myself so much in love with life as to return to that captivity
and intolerable oppression from which we have gotten away.
Therefore, be assured, we will all drown rather than go back.'</p>

<p>'Oh!' she sighed, but with relief, 'now shall I fear nothing.
I have not lost everything, since I have thee still&mdash;and Barnaby.
Alas! my head has been so full of what Madam said&mdash;that we
should be certainly caught, and all of us flogged. To be flogged!
Who would not rather die?'&mdash;she shivered and trembled. 'To
be flogged!&mdash;Humphrey, I could not bear the shame!' She
trembled and shivered as she repeated this confession of fear.</p>

<p>'Fear not, my dear,' I said; 'there are those on the boat who
love thee too well to suffer that extreme of barbarity. Put that
fear out of thy mind. Think only that we may have to die, but
that we shall not be taken. To die, indeed, is very likely our
fate: for we have but a quarter of an inch of frail wood between
us and the seas. If a storm should arise, we fill with water and
go down; if the wind should drop we should be becalmed, and so
perish miserably of hunger and thirst; if Barnaby steer not
aright&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span></p>

<p>'Humphrey,' said Barnaby, 'fill not her innocent head with
rubbish. 'Tis not the time of tornadoes, and there will be no
storm. The wind at this season never drops, therefore we shall
not lie becalmed. And as for my steering aright, why, with a
compass&mdash;am I a lubber?'</p>

<p>'Brother,' she said, 'if I am not to be flogged, the rest concerns
me little. Let us say no more about it. I am now easy in
my mind. Robin sleeps, Humphrey. He hath slept since the sun
went down, and this afternoon he looked as if he knew me. Also,
he took the bread sopped in Canary eagerly, as if he relished it.'</p>

<p>'These seas,' said Barnaby, 'are full of sharks.'</p>

<p>I knew not what he meant, because we were speaking of Robin.</p>

<p>'Sharks have got their senses, as well as humans,' he went on.</p>

<p>Still I understood him not.</p>

<p>'When a man on board a ship is going to die, the sharks find
it out, and they follow that ship until he does die and is flung overboard.
Then they devour his body and go away, unless there is
more to follow. I have looked for sharks, and there are none
following the boat; wherefore, though I am not a doctor, I am
sure that Robin will not die.'</p>

<p>'I know not at all,' I said, 'how that may be. There are
many things believed by sailors which are superstitions&mdash;fond
beliefs nourished by the continual presence of perils. On the
other hand, the senses of man are notoriously as far below those of
creatures as his intellect is above them (yet a skilful man may
read the premonition of death in a sick man's face). Therefore I
know not but a shark may have a sense, like unto the eye of a
hawk or the scent of a hound, with which to sniff the approach of
death afar off. Let us comfort ourselves, Alice, with Barnaby's
assurance.'</p>

<p>''Tis a well proved and tried thing,' said Barnaby; 'and
sailors, let me tell thee, Master Doctor, have no superstitions or
idle beliefs.'</p>

<p>'Well, that may be. As to Robin's disease, I can pronounce
nothing upon it. Nay, had I the whole library of Padua to consult,
I could learn nothing that would help me. First, the mind
falls into a languishing and spiritless condition. That causeth
the body to lie open to attacks of any disease which may be
threatening. Then, the body, being ill at ease, works upon the
mind, and causes it to wander beyond control. So that the soul,
which is bound up with body and mind, cannot show herself or
manifest her will. It is the will which shows the presence of the
soul: the will which governs body and mind alike. But if I know
aught of disease, if a change comes upon Robin it will either swiftly
cure or swiftly kill.'</p>

<p>'Humphrey,' she whispered, 'if he recover, how shall I meet
his face? How shall I reply when he asks me concerning my
faith?'</p>

<p>'My dear, he knows all. 'Twas that knowledge, the pity of it,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
and the madness of it, believe me, which threw him into so low a
condition.'</p>

<p>'I have looked daily for reproaches in thy kind eyes, Humphrey.
I have found none, truly. But from Robin&mdash;oh! I dare
not think of meeting those eyes of his.'</p>

<p>'Reproach thee will he never, Alice. Sorrow and love, I doubt
not, will lie in his eyes all his life. What thou hast done was for
him and for thy father and thy brother and for all of us. But,
oh! the pity&mdash;and the villainy! Fear not to meet the poor lad's
eyes, Alice.'</p>

<p>'I long to see the light of reason in those dear eyes&mdash;and yet
I fear. Humphrey, I am married; but against my will. I am a
wife, and yet no wife; I am resolved that, come what may, I will
never, never go to my husband. And I love my Robin still&mdash;oh!'
she sobbed, 'I love my Robin still!'</p>

<p>'If we die,' I told her, 'you shall go down with your arm round
his neck, and so you shall die together.'</p>

<p>Then we sat silent a while.</p>

<p>'My dear,' I said, 'lie down and take some sleep.'</p>

<p>'I cannot sleep, Humphrey, for the peace of mind which hath
fallen me upon. If Robin now come to his senses again I shall
not fear him. And the night, it is so peaceful&mdash;so cool and so
peaceful;' the wind had dropped, till there was barely enough to
fill the sail, and only enough way on the boat to make a soft murmur
of the water along her sides. 'The sea is so smooth; the sky
is so bright and so full of stars. Can there be, anywhere, a peace
like this? Alas! if we could sail still upon a silent and peaceful
ocean! But we must land somewhere. There will be men, and
where there are men there is wickedness, with drink and wrath
and evil passions&mdash;such as we have left behind us. Humphrey&mdash;oh!
my brother Humphrey!&mdash;it would be sweet if the boat would
sink beneath us now, and so, with Robin's hand in mine, we could
all go together to the happy land, where there is neither marrying
nor giving in marriage.'</p>

<p>From beneath the tilt there came a voice&mdash;I verily believe it
was an answer sent straight from heaven to comfort this poor faithful
soul. 'Alice'&mdash;it was the voice of Robin, in his right mind at
last. 'Alice,' he said, 'we will continue to love each other, yet
without sin.'</p>

<p>'Oh, Robin! Robin!' she moved quickly to his side and fell
upon her knees. 'Robin, thou wilt recover?'</p>

<p>'Stay!' I interposed. 'Robin will first have a cup of cordial.'</p>

<p>'I have been sleeping,' he said; 'I know not what hath happened.
We are in a boat, it seems, and on the open sea.
Unless I am still dreaming, we are slaves to a planter in Barbadoes!
And this is Alice&mdash;who was in England! And I know
not what it means.'</p>

<p>'You have been ill, Robin,' I told him. 'You have been nigh
unto death. Many things have happened of which we will speak,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>
but not now. Alice is at your side, and Barnaby is navigating the
boat. Drink this cup of wine&mdash;so&mdash;sleep now; and in the morning,
if it please Heaven, you shall be so strong that you shall
hear everything. Ask no more questions, but sleep. Give him
your hand, Alice.'</p>

<p>She obeyed me, sitting at his side and taking his hand in hers,
and so continued for the rest of the night, Robin sleeping peacefully.</p>

<p>In a word, he was restored. The fresh sea-breeze brought
him back to life and reason; and, though he was still weak, he
was now as sound in his mind as any man could desire to be.
And in the morning we told him all that had been done, whereat
he marvelled.</p>

<p>Alice might love him still. That was most true, yet between
them stood her husband. Why, there was another man in the boat
who also loved a girl he could never wed. His passion, I swear,
was full of constancy, tenderness, and patience. Would Robin
be as patient?</p>

<p>When the day broke again we were still sailing over a lonely
sea, with never a sail in sight, and never a sign of land.</p>

<p>And now Robin was sitting up, his face pale, and his hands thin.
But the light of reason was in his eyes, and on his lips such a
smile of tenderness as we were wont to see there in the days of
old.</p>

<p>'Said I not,' cried Barnaby, 'that he would recover? Trust
the sharks for common-sense. And again an open sea, with never
a sail in sight. Praise the Lord, therefore!'</p>

<p>But Alice, when the sun rose above the waves, threw back her
hood and burst forth into singing:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">O Lord, how glorious is Thy grace,</span>
<span class="i2">And wondrous large Thy love!</span>
<span class="i0">At such a dreadful time and place,</span>
<span class="i2">To such as faithful prove.</span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>The tears came into my eyes only to see the change that had
fallen upon her gracious, smiling countenance. It was not, truly,
the sweet and happy face that we remembered before her troubles
fell upon her, but that face graver with the knowledge of evil
and of pain. And now it was like unto such a face as one may
see in many an altar-piece in Italy, glorified with gratitude and
love.</p>

<p>Then the woman called Deb fell to weeping and blubbering
for very joy that her mistress looked happy again. 'Twas a faithful,
loving creature.</p>

<p>'Humphrey,' said Alice, 'forgive me that I murmured.
Things that are done cannot be undone. Robin is restored to
us. With three such brothers, who should not be content to live?
I hope, now, that we shall get safely to our port; but if we die,
we shall die contented in each other's arms. Going through the
Vale of Misery,' she added softly, 'we will use it as a well.'</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XLVII.</h2>

<h3>TORTUGA.</h3>


<div class="drop">
<img src="images/i_340.jpg" alt="I" width="100" height="99" class="cap" />
 <p class="cap_1">'I take it,' said Barnaby, on the third morning&mdash;the
weather continuing fine and the sea clear of
ships&mdash;'that we are now clear out of the track of
any British vessels. We may fall into the hands of
the Spaniard; but he is mild and merciful of late
compared with his temper a hundred years ago. 'Tis true we
have given him many lessons in humanity. We should now
before nightfall make the islands of Testigos; but I think they
are only rocks and sandy flats, such as they call Keys, where we
need not land, seeing that we should get nothing by so doing,
except to go out of the way, and so make the rations shorter.
Robin'&mdash;'twas at breakfast, when he served out a dram of wine
to every one&mdash;'I drink to thy better health, lad. Thou hast
cheated the Devil. Nay, Sis, look not so angry!&mdash;I meant,
thou wilt not go to heaven this bout. Up heart, then, and get
strong! We will find thee another sweetheart, who shall make
thee lift up thine head again. What? Is there but one woman
in the world?</p>
</div>

<p>'I was saying then,' he went on, 'that we shall presently make
the islands of Testigos. There followeth thereafter, to one who
steereth west, a swarm of little islands. 'Twas here that the
pirates used to lie in the good old days, snug and retired, with
their girls and their drink. Ay, and plenty of both! A happy
time they had!' Barnaby wagged his head and sighed. 'South
of this archipelago (which I will some day visit, in order to search
for treasure) there lieth the great and mountainous island of Margaritos.
This great island we shall do well to keep upon our south,
and so bear away to the desert island of Tortuga, where we shall
find water for certain&mdash;and that, I have been told, the best spring-water
that flows; turtles we may also find, and fish we may catch;
and when we have recovered our strength, with a few days' rest
ashore, we will once more put to sea and make for the island of
CuraÃ§ao and the protection of the Dutchmen.'</p>

<p>It needs not to tell much more about the voyage, in which we
were favoured by Heaven with everything that we could desire&mdash;a
steady breeze from the best quarter, a sea never too rough,
provisions in sufficiency, the absence of any ships, and, above all,
the recovery of Robin.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span></p>

<p>I say, then, that we sighted (and presently passed) the group of
islets called the Testigos; that we coasted along the great island
of Margaritos, where we landed not, because Barnaby feared that
certain smoke which we saw might betoken the presence of the
Spaniard, whom, in spite of his new character for mildness, he was
anxious to avoid. 'Tis strange thus to sail along the shore of a
great island whereon are no inhabitants, or, if any, a few sailors
put in for water, for turtle, and for cocoanuts; to see afar off the
forests climbing round the mountain sides, the waterfalls leaping
over the precipices, and to think of the happy life one might lead
in such a place, far from men and their ways. I confess (since
my Mistress will never see this page) that my thoughts for a
whole day, while we sailed along the shores of Margaritos,
turned upon those pirates of whom Barnaby spoke. They lived
here at ease, and in great happiness. 'Tis of such a life that a
man sometimes dreams. But if he were suffered so to lie in sloth,
farewell Heaven! Farewell future hopes! Farewell our old
talk of lifting the soul above the flesh! Let us henceforth live
the lives of those who are content (since they can have no more)
with a few years of love and wine and revelry! It is in climates
like that of the West Indies that such a temptation seizes on men
the most strongly: for here everything is made for man's enjoyment;
here is no cold, no frost, no snow or ice; here eternal
summer reigns, and the world seems made for the senses and for
nothing else. Of these confessions enough. 'Twas impossible
that in such a luxurious dream the image of Alice could have any
part.</p>

<p>We landed, therefore, on the desert island of Tortuga, where we
remained for several days, hauling up our boat and covering her
with branches to keep off the sun. Here we lived luxuriously
upon turtle, fresh fish, the remains of our bread, and what was left
of our Canary; setting up huts in which we could sleep, and finding
water of the freshest and brightest I ever saw. Here Robin
mended apace, and began to walk about with no more help from
his nurses.</p>

<p>We were minded, as I have said, to sail as far as the island of
CuraÃ§ao, but an accident prevented this.</p>

<p>One day, when we had been ashore for ten days or thereabouts,
we were terrified by the sight of a small vessel rigged in the fashion
of a ketch&mdash;that is, with a small mizzen&mdash;beating about outside the
bay which is the only port of Tortuga.</p>

<p>'She will put in here,' said Barnaby. 'That is most certain.
Now, from the cut of her she is of New England build, and from
the handling of her she is under-manned; and I think that we have
nothing to fear from her, unless she is bound for Barbadoes, or for
Grenada, or Jamaica.'</p>

<p>Presently the vessel came to anchor, and a small boat was
lowered, into which three men descended. They were unarmed.</p>

<p>'She is certainly from New England,' said Barnaby. 'Well,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
they are not from Barbadoes in quest of us, otherwise they would
not send ashore three unarmed men to capture four desperate men.
That is certain. And as we cannot hide our boat, though we might
hide ourselves, I will e'en go forth and parley with these strangers.'</p>

<p>This he did, we watching from a safe place. The conversation
was long and earnest, and apparently friendly. Presently Barnaby
returned to us.</p>

<p>'There offers,' he said, 'a chance which is perhaps better than
to make for CuraÃ§ao, where, after all, we might get scurvy treatment.
These men, in a word, are privateers; or, since we are at
war with none, they are pirates. They fitted out a brigantine, or
bilander (I know not which), and designed to sail round Cape Horn
to attack the Spaniard on the South Seas. On the way they took
a prize, which you now see in the bay. Ten men were sent aboard
to navigate her as a tender to their ship. But they fell into bad
weather off Brazil, and their ship went down with all hands. Now
they are bound for Providence, only seven hands left, and they
will take us aboard and carry us to that island for our services.
Truly, I think we should go. They have provisions in plenty, with
Madeira wine; and Providence is too far for the arm of King James
to reach. What say ye all? Alice, what sayest thou?'</p>

<p>'Truly, brother, I say nothing.'</p>

<p>'Then we will agree, and go with them.'</p>

<p>We went on board, taking with us a good supply of turtle, clear
water, and cocoanuts (being all that the isle afforded). Honest fellows
we found our pirates to be. They belonged to the island of
Providence, in the Bahamas, which has long been the rendezvous
of English privateers. Ten years before this the Spaniards plucked
up courage to attack and destroy the settlement, when those who
escaped destruction found shelter in some of the adjacent islands,
or on the mainland of Virginia. Now some of them have come back
again, and this settlement, or colony, is re-established.</p>

<p>Thither, therefore, we sailed. It seemed as if we were become
a mere shuttlecock of fortune, beaten and driven hither and thither
upon the face of the earth.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XLVIII.</h2>

<h3>THE ISLAND OF PROVIDENCE.</h3>


<div class="drop">
<img src="images/i_343.jpg" alt="I" width="100" height="99" class="cap" />
 <p class="cap_1">I t was some time in the month of March, <small>A.D.</small> 1686,
that we landed in Providence. The settlement&mdash;from
which the Spaniards had now nothing to fear&mdash;then
consisted (it is now, I learn, much larger) of no
more than one hundred and fifty people in all, the
men being all sailors, and ready to carry on again the
old trade of privateer or pirate, as you please to call it, when they
should be strong enough to buy or hire a ship and to equip her.</p>
</div>

<p>We stayed on the island for two years and a quarter, or thereabouts.
It is one of an archipelago, for the most part, I believe,
desert. The settlement was, as I have said, but a small one, living
in scattered houses; there were plenty of these to spare (which had
belonged to the former settlement), if one only took the trouble to
clear away the creeping plants and cut down the trees which had
grown up round them since the Spaniards came and destroyed the
colony. Such a house, built of wood, with a shingle roof, we found
convenient for us; and after we had cleared the ground round it
and repaired it, we lived in it. Some of the people helped us to a
porker or two and some chickens. They also gave us some salt
beef and maize to start with. That we had little money (only what
was left over from the sale of Alice's ring) made no difference to us
here, because no one had any at all, and at this time there was
neither buying nor selling on the island&mdash;a happy condition of
things which will not, I take it, last long. So great is the fertility
of the ground here, and such is the abundance which prevails, that
we very shortly found ourselves provided with all that we wanted
to make life pleasant. Work there was for us, but easy and pleasant
work&mdash;such as weeding our patches of vegetables and fruit in
the early mornings; or going to fish; or planting maize; or attending
to our pigs, poultry, and turkeys; and for the rest of the time,
sitting in the shade conversing. It is none too hot in this place,
though one would not in the summer walk abroad at noon; nor is
it ever too cold. All the fruits which flourish under the tropics
grow here, with those also which belong to the temperate zone.
Here are splendid forests, where you can cut the mahogany-tree, and
build your house, if you please, of that lovely wood. Here we ourselves<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>
grew, for our own use, maize, tobacco, coffee, cocoa, plantains,
pines, potatoes, and many other fruits and vegetables.</p>

<p>Barnaby soon grew tired of this quiet life, and went on board a
schooner bound for New England, promising that we should hear
from him. After two years we did receive a letter from him, as
you shall immediately learn. When he was gone we carried on a
quiet and peaceful life. Books, paper, and pen there were none
upon this island. Nor were there any clothes, so that the raggedness
of our attire (we were dressed in the sailors' clothes our friends
the privateers gave us) became incredible. I made some kind of
guitar on which we played, and in the evening we would have very
good playing and singing together of such pieces and songs as we
could remember. I made verses, too, for amusement, and Alice
learned them. We found our brother-settlers a rough but honest
folk, to whom we taught many arts: how to procure sea-salt, how
to make wine from pineapples, how to cure the tobacco-leaf&mdash;things
which greatly added to their comfort; and, seeing that
there was no church on the island, we every Sabbath held a
meeting for prayer and exhortation.</p>

<p>Seeing, then, that we had all that man could desire, with perfect
freedom from anxiety, our liberty, a delightful climate, plenty
to eat and drink&mdash;ay, and of the very best&mdash;and that at home there
was nothing for us but prison again, and to be sent back to the
place whence we had escaped, we ought, every one will acknowledge,
to have felt the greatest contentment and gratitude for this
sure and quiet refuge. We did not. The only contented members
of our household were John Nuthall and the woman Deb, who
cheerfully cultivated the garden and fed the poultry and the pigs
(for we had now everything around us that is wanted to make life
pleasant). Yet we were not contented. I could read the signs of
impatience in the face whose changes I had studied for so long.
Other women would have shown their discontent in ill-temper and
a shrewish tongue; Alice showed hers in silence, sitting apart, and
communing with herself. I daresay I also showed my discontent;
for I confess that I now began to long vehemently for books. Consider,
it was more than two years since I had seen a book! There
were no books at all on the island of Providence&mdash;not one book,
except a Bible or two, and, perhaps, a Book of Common Prayer. I
longed, therefore, for the smell of leather bindings, the sight of
books on shelves, and the holy company of the wise and the ingenious.
No one, again, could look upon Robin without perceiving
that he was afflicted with a constant yearning for that which he
could not have. What that was I understood very well, although
he never opened his mind unto me.</p>

<p>Now I confess that at this time I was grievously tormented with
the thought that, Alice's marriage having been no true marriage&mdash;because,
first, she was betrayed and deceived; and, next, she had
left her husband at the very church porch&mdash;there was no reason in
the world why she should not disregard that ceremony altogether,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>
and contract a marriage after her own heart. I turned this over
in my mind a long while; and, indeed, I am still of the opinion
that there would have been nothing sinful in such an act. But the
law of the country would not so regard it. That is quite true. If,
therefore, I had advised these unhappy lovers in such a sense they
would have been compelled to live for the rest of their lives on this
island, and their offspring would have been illegitimate. So that,
though the letter of the law caused a most cruel in justice&mdash;<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">summum
jus summa injuria</i>&mdash;it was better that it should be obeyed. In the
end, it was a most happy circumstance that it was so obeyed.</p>

<p>I have presently to relate the means by which this injustice was
removed. As for my own share in it, I shall neither exaggerate nor
shall I extenuate it. I shall not defend it. I will simply set it
down, and leave judgment to a higher Court than the opinion of
those who read these pages. I must, however, acknowledge that,
partly in Barbadoes and partly in Providence, I learned from the
negresses, who possess many secrets and have a wonderful knowledge
of plants and their powers, the simple remedies with which
they treat fevers, agues, rheumatisms, and other common disorders.
I say simple, because they will, with a single cup of liquor boiled
with certain leaves, or with a pinch of some potent powder gotten
from a plant, effect a speedier cure than our longest prescriptions,
even though they contain more than fifty different ingredients.
Had I possessed this knowledge, for example, while we lay in
Exeter Jail, not one prisoner (except the old and feeble) should
have died of the fever. This said, you will understand presently
what it was I did.</p>

<p>It was, then, about the month of March, in the year 1688, that a
ship, laden with wine, and bound from New York to Jamaica, put
in at the port of Providence. Her captain carried a letter for me,
and this was the first news of the world that came to us since our
flight.</p>

<p>The letter was from Barnaby. It was short, because Barnaby
had never practised the art of letter-writing; but it was pertinent.
First, he told us that he had made the acquaintance at Boston (I
mean the little town Boston of New England) of his cousins, whom
he found to be substantial merchants (so that here, at least, the
man George Penne lied not), and zealous upholders of the Independent
way of thinking; that these cousins had given him a
hearty welcome for the sake of his father; that he had learned
from them, first, that the Monmouth business was long since concluded,
and, so great was the public indignation against the cruelties
of the Bloody Assize, that no one would again be molested on that
account, not even those who had been sent abroad should they
venture to return. He also said&mdash;but this we understood not&mdash;that
it was thought things would before long improve.</p>

<p>'And now,' he concluded, 'my cousins, finding that I am well
skilled and have already navigated a ship with credit, have made
me captain of their own vessel, the <em>Pilgrim</em>, which sails every year<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span>
to Bristol and back again. She will be despatched in the month of
August or September. Come, therefore, by the first ship which
will set you ashore either at New York or at Boston, and I will
give you all a passage home. Afterwards, if you find not a welcome
there, you may come back with me. Here a physician may find
practice, Robin may find a farm, and sister will be safe from B. B.'</p>

<p>At this proposal we pricked up our ears, as you may very well
believe. Finally we resolved to agree to it, promising each other
to protect Alice from her husband, and to go back to Boston with
Barnaby if we found no reason to stay in England. But the woman
Deb, though she wept at leaving her mistress, would not go back to
the place where her past wickedness might be remembered, and
John Nuthall was also unwilling, for the same reason, to return;
and, as this honest couple had now a kindness for each other, I
advised them to marry and remain where they were. There was
on the island no minister of religion, nor any magistrate or form of
government whatever (yet all were honest); therefore I ventured
to hear their vows of fidelity, and prayed with them while I joined
their hands&mdash;a form of marriage, to my mind, as binding and as
sacred as any wanting the assistance of a priest. So we handed
over to them all our property (which was already as much theirs as
ours), and left them in that sunny and delightful place. If the man
was a repentant thief, the woman was a repentant magdalen, and
so they were well matched. I hope and believe that, being well
resolved for the future, they will lead a godly and virtuous life, and
will be blessed with children who will never learn the reason why
their parents left their native country.</p>

<p>There is little trade at Providence, but many vessels touch at
the port, because it lies between the English possessions in America
and those in the West Indies. They put in for water, for fruit,
and sometimes, if they are short-handed, for men, most of them in
the place being sailors. Therefore we had not to wait long before a
vessel put in, bound from Jamaica to New York. We bargained
with the captain for a passage, agreeing that he should find us
provisions and wine, and that we would pay him (by means of
Barnaby) on our reaching Boston (which is but a short distance
from New York). Strange to say, though we had been discontented
with our lot, when we sailed away Alice fell to weeping. We had
murmured, and our murmuring was heard. We should now be
permitted to live out what was left to us of life in England, and we
should die and be buried among our own folk. Yet there are times
when I remember the sweet and tranquil life we led in the island
of Providence, its soft and sunny air, the cool sea-breeze, the
shade of its orange groves, and the fruits which grew in such
abundance to our hands.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XLIX.</h2>

<h3>HOME.</h3>


<div class="drop">
<img src="images/i_347.jpg" alt="I" width="100" height="99" class="cap" />
 <p class="cap_1">I n one thing alone the villain Penne spoke the truth.
The Eykin family of Boston (I say again of New England)
was one of the most considerable in the place&mdash;great
sticklers for freedom and for religion (but, indeed,
it is a most God-fearing town, and severe towards
transgressors). They received us with so much kindness
that nothing could surpass it; we were treated as Christian
martyrs at the least, and towards Alice, of whose cruel lot they had
heard from Barnaby, they showed (but that no one could help)
an affection quite uncommon. They generously furnished us all
with apparel becoming our station, and with money for our daily
occasions; they approved of our going with Barnaby; but, in the
event of our finding no welcome or means of a livelihood at home,
and if Alice should be molested by her husband, they engaged us
to return to New England. Here, they said, Robin might become
a farmer, if he had no inclination for trade; they would joyfully
receive Alice to live with them; and I myself would certainly find
practice as a physician; while Barnaby should continue to command
their ship. When I considered the many conveniences which exist
in Boston (it is already, though young, better provided with everything
than Barbadoes), the excellence of the climate, the books which
are there, the printing press which hath already been established,
the learned ministers, the college, the schools, and the freedom of
religion, I should have been nothing loth to remain there. But I
was constrained first to go home. I found also, which astonished
me, so great a love of liberty that the people speak slightingly of the
English at home who tamely suffer the disabilities of the Nonconformists
and the prerogative of the Crown; and they ask why, when
the country had succeeded in establishing a Commonwealth, they could
not keep it? It certainly cannot be denied, as they argue, that
Israel acted against the declared will of the Lord in seeking a king.</p>
</div>

<p>So we left them. But in how changed a condition did we now
cross the ocean! Instead of huddling in a noisome and stinking
dungeon, unclean for want of water, ill fed, and with no change of
raiment, we had now comfortable cabins, clothes such as become a
gentleman, and food of the best. And Barnaby, who had then sat
humbly in the waist, where the prisoners were confined, now
walked the quarterdeck&mdash;a laced kerchief round his neck, lace
ruffles at his wrist, a scarlet coat on his back, a sword at his side,
and gold lace in his hat: the captain of the ship.</p>

<p>The winds were contrary, and it was not until the last days of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>
October that we arrived at Bristol. Here we lay for a few days,
while Barnaby transacted his business, resolving to remain in
retirement, for fear of accidents, until our captain should be ready
to ride with us to Bradford Orcas.</p>

<p>The first news we learned was joyful indeed. It was that the
Prince of Orange himself was about to invade England, with intent to
drive his father-in-law from the throne. (He had indeed already
sailed, but his fleet was driven back by a storm.) It was also stated
that he had with him a great army of Dutch and English, and such
preparations of arms and ammunition as (it was hoped) would make
such a failure as that of our unhappy Duke impossible.</p>

<p>We also confirmed Barnaby's information that Monmouth's men
could now go about without fear or molestation.</p>

<p>As to the position of affairs at Bradford Orcas, we could learn
nothing.</p>

<p>There was one point on which I was curious&mdash;namely, as to
what Barnaby would do in the matter of the villain Penne. On
the one hand it was certain that Barnaby would not forget this
man, nor was he likely to sit down with his arms folded after he
had been robbed of so great a sum.</p>

<p>Therefore, I was not surprised when, the evening before we
rode out of Bristol, he brought a big bag of blue stuff in his hands
and poured out the contents&mdash;a vast shower of gold pieces&mdash;into
the lap of his astonished sister.</p>

<p>'Alice,' he said, 'I bring you back your money. You will find
it all here, and Mr. Boscorel's money to boot. He hath disgorged.'</p>

<p>With that he sat down and laughed, but as one who hath a joke
in secret and would tell us no more.</p>

<p>For a day or two after this he would (on the road to Bradford
Orcas) begin to laugh at intervals, rolling about in his saddle, shaking
his sides, choking with laughter; insomuch that I presently lost
patience with him, and, as a physician, ordered him instantly to make
full confidence, or I would not answer for it but he would have a fit.</p>

<p>Then he told us what he had done.</p>

<p>Towards five in the afternoon, when the autumn day is ended, he
repaired to the man Penne's counting-house (a place easily found on
inquiry), having with him one of those fellows who bawl at fairs,
selling medicines and charms, drawing teeth, letting blood, and so
forth. At the sight of a sea captain, many of whom came to this
place, the worthy merchant's servant, without suspicion, opened
the door of the private office, or chamber, where Mr. Penne transacted
his affairs. Barnaby found him dozing by the fire, his wig
on the table, a silk handkerchief over his head, and the candles
already lighted.</p>

<p>He awoke, however, on the opening of the door.</p>

<p>'Friend,' said Barnaby, 'I am Captain Barnaby Eykin, commanding
the ship <em>Pilgrim</em>, from Boston&mdash;at your service. I am
also brother to the young woman Alice Eykin, whom you robbed
('twas my money) of two hundred and fifty pounds, and afterwards
kidnapped.'</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 439px;">
<img src="images/i_349.jpg" width="439" height="600" alt="pistol" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">'<i>Barnaby holding the pistol to the poor wretch's head, so that he should
not bellow and call for assistance.</i>'</p></div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Penne looked about him, and would have cried out for
assistance; but Barnaby clapped a pistol to his forehead. Then he
sank in his chair and gasped.</p>

<p>'Stir not,' said his enemy, 'I am also one of the three rebels
for whose ransom the Reverend Philip Boscorel, Rector of Bradford
Orcas, paid the sum of two hundred and ten pounds&mdash;which
you have also stolen.'</p>

<p>'Sir,' said Mr. Penne, 'upon my honour those moneys were
sent to Barbadoes. Upon my honour, sir.'</p>

<p>'You will therefore,' said Barnaby, taking no heed of this
assurance, 'pay over to me the sum of four hundred and sixty
pounds, with interest at five per cent. for three years, which I have
calculated; the whole amount is five hundred and twenty-nine
pounds. Begin by paying this.' Well, to make a long story short,
though the man protested that he had not so much in the world,
yet he presently opened his strong box and counted out the money,
all in gold. This done, he hoped to be let off.</p>

<p>'There now remains,' said Barnaby, 'the punishment&mdash;and I
forgot sister's ring: I ought to have added fifty pounds for that.
But time presses. Perhaps I shall come back. I did intend to
kill thee, brother, for thy great villany. However&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>He then beckoned the man with him, who lugged out of his
pocket an instrument which made Mr. Penne shake and quake with
terror. Barnaby then informed his victim that, as he had been
the means of inflicting grievous bodily suffering upon four undeserving
people, it was meet and right that he himself should experience
something which, by its present agony, should make him compassionate
for the future, and by its permanence of injury should
prevent his ever forgetting that compassion for the rest of his
life.</p>

<p>He therefore, he told him, intended to draw from his head four
of his stoutest and strongest grinders.</p>

<p>This, in a word, he did; the man with him dragging them out
with the pincers; Barnaby holding the pistol to the poor wretch's
head, so that he should not bellow and call for assistance.</p>

<p>His laughter was caused by the remembrance of the twisting of
the man's features in this agony, and by his moanings and groanings.
The grinders he had brought away with him in his pocket,
and showed them in triumph.</p>

<p>It was late in the afternoon when we rode into Bradford Orcas.
The November sun, now setting, lay upon the woods, yellow and red
with the autumn leaves not yet fallen. As we neared the village the
sun went down, and a mist began to rise. All the doors were closed,
and no one looked forth to greet us; the old cottage where Alice was
born and where she lived so long was empty still; the door was open,
the shutter hung upon one hinge; the honey hives were overturned,
the thatch was broken; the garden was neglected.</p>

<p>'Why, Sis,' said Barnaby, 'thy mother is not there; nor Dad,&mdash;is
he?&mdash;poor old Dad!'</p>

<p>We rode up the village till we came to the church, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span>
Manor House beside it. Alas! the house itself was closed, which
had formerly stood open to all. There was no smoke from its
chimneys, and the grass grew in the courtyard. We dismounted
and opened the door, which was not locked. We went into the
house: all was cold, and empty, and deserted. The twilight
falling outside made the rooms dark. Beside the fireplace stood
Sir Christopher's great chair, empty! his tankard was on the table
and his tobacco-pipe, and&mdash;strange!&mdash;there lay, forgotten, the unhappy
Duke's Proclamation.</p>

<p>Then a truly wonderful thing happened. Barnaby says that I
must have dreamed it, for he saw nothing. Suddenly Sir Christopher
himself appeared sitting in the chair; on his knees lay the
Bible open. Beside him stood, with upraised forefinger, as if
commenting on some knotty point, the Rev. Dr. Comfort Eykin.
I declare that I saw them plainly, as plainly as I now behold the
paper on which I write. They were but as shadows in the dark
shadows of the empty room, and they appeared but for a moment,
and then vanished, and I saw them no more.</p>

<p>'Come to the Rectory,' said Robin; 'it chokes us to be here.'</p>

<p>'Listen,' said Alice, outside the house.</p>

<p>From the Rectory there came the sound of a violoncello. Then
was the good Rector himself there, comforting his soul.</p>

<p>We opened the garden-gate and walked softly across the lawn
and looked in at the window ('twas made after the foreign fashion,
to open upon the lawn). Beside the fire sat Madam, her hands
clasped, thin, pale, and prematurely aged. Thus had she sat for
three long years, still waiting for news of her son.</p>

<p>The Rector laid down his bow, crossed the room and sat down
to the spinnet (on which he played prettily, but not with such
command as he possessed over the other instrument). He played&mdash;I
caught Alice's hand&mdash;an air of my own making to which I had
set certain words, also of my own.</p>

<p>Then, while he played, we began to sing outside the window, Alice
singing treble, or first, I the second part, and Robin the bass, as I had
taught him in Providence Island the words of that little song. We
sang it <em>piano</em>, or softly, at first, and then <em>crescendo</em>, or louder:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">As rides the moon in azure skies</span>
<span class="i2">The twinkling stars beside;</span>
<span class="i0">As when in splendour she doth rise,</span>
<span class="i2">Their lesser lights they hide.</span>
<span class="i0">So beside Celia, when her face we see,</span>
<span class="i2">All unregarded other maidens be.</span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p class="noind">When we began, softly as I said, the Rector looked round him,
playing still and listening. He thought the voices were in his own
brain&mdash;echoes or memories of the past. Madam heard them too,
and sat up listening as one who listens in a dream. When we sang
louder Madam sprang to her feet, and held out her arms&mdash;but the
Rector played the verse quite through. Then he opened the window
for us.</p>

<p>'My son! my son!' cried Madam.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER L.</h2>

<h3>THE GREAT LORD CHANCELLOR.</h3>


<div class="drop">
<img src="images/i_353.jpg" alt="B" width="100" height="102" class="cap" />
 <p class="cap_1">But the Prince of Orange had already landed.</p>
</div>

<p>We learned this news next day, and you may be
sure that we were in the saddle again and riding to
Exeter, there to join his standard.</p>

<p>This we did with the full consent of Madam and
of Alice. Much as we had suffered already, they would
not deter us, because this thing would have been approved by Sir
Christopher and Dr. Eykin. Therefore we went. As all the world
knows, this expedition was successful. Yet was not Barnaby made an
Admiral, nor was I made a Court physician; we got, in fact, no
reward at all, except that for Barnaby was procured a full pardon
on account of the homicide of his late master.</p>

<p>My second campaign, as everybody knows, was bloodless. To
begin with, we had an army, not of raw country lads armed indifferently
and untrained, but of veteran troops, fifteen thousand
strong, all well equipped, and with the best General in Europe at
their head. At first, indeed, such was the dread in men's minds
caused by Lord Jeffreys' cruelties, few came in; yet this was
presently made up by what followed, when, without any fighting
at all, the King's regiments melted away, his priests fled, and his
friends deserted him. This was a very different business from that
other, when we followed one whom I now know to have been a
mere tawdry pretender, no better fitted to be a King than a vagabond
actor at a fair is fit to be a Lord. Alas! what blood was
wasted in that mad attempt!&mdash;of which I was myself one of the
most eager promoters. I was then young, and I believed all that
I was told by the conspirators in Holland; I took their list of
well-wishers for insurgents already armed and waiting only for a
signal; I thought that the roll of noble names set down for sturdy
Protestants was that of men already pledged to the Cause; I believed
that the whole nation would rise at the first opportunity to turn
out the priests; I even believed in the legitimacy of the Duke, and
that against the express statement of his father (if King Charles
was in reality his father); and I believed what they told me of his
princely virtues, his knowledge of the art of war, and his heroic
valour. I say that I believed all these things and that I became a
willing and zealous tool in their hands. As for what those who
planned the expedition believed, I know not; nor will any one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span>
now ever learn what promises were made to the Duke, what were
broken, and why he was, from the outset, save for a few days at
Taunton, so dejected and disappointed. As for me, I shall always
believe that the unhappy man&mdash;unwise and soft-hearted&mdash;was
betrayed by those whom he trusted.</p>

<p>It is now an old tale, though King Monmouth will not speedily
be forgotten in the West Country, nor will the memory of the
Bloody Assize. The brave lads who followed him are dead and
buried; some in unhonoured graves hard by the place where they
were hanged, some under the burning sun of the West Indies. The
Duke himself hath long since paid the penalty of his rash attempt.
All is over and ended, except the memory of it.</p>

<p>It is now common history, known to everybody, how the Prince
of Orange lingered in the West Country, his army inactive, as if he
knew (doubtless he was well informed upon this particular) that the
longer he remained idle the more likely was the King's Cause to fall
to pieces. There are some who think that if King James had risked
an action he could not but have gained, whatsoever its event&mdash;I
mean that, the blood of his soldiers once roused, they would have
remained steadfast to him, and would have fought for him. But
this he dared not to risk; wherefore the Prince did nothing, while
the King's regiments fell to pieces and his friends deserted him. It
was in December when the Prince came to Windsor, and I with
him, once more Chyrurgeon in a rebel army. While there I rode
to London&mdash;partly with the intention of judging for myself as to
the temper of the people; partly because, after so long an absence,
I wished once more to visit a place where there are books and pictures;
and partly because there were certain notes and herbs which
I desired to communicate to the College of Physicians in Warwick
Lane. It happened to be the very day when the King's first flight&mdash;that,
namely, when he was taken in the Isle of Sheppey&mdash;became
known. The streets in the City of London I found crowded with
people hurrying to and fro, running in bands and companies, shouting
and crying, as if in the presence of some great and imminent
danger. It was reported and currently believed that the disbanded
Irish soldiers had begun to massacre the Protestants. There was
no truth at all in the report; but yet the bells were ringing from
all the towers, the crowds were exhorting each other to tear down
and destroy the Romish chapels, to hunt for and to hang the
priests, and especially Jesuits (I know not whether they found
any), and to shout for the Prince of Orange. I stood aside to let
the crowds (thus religiously disposed) run past, but there seemed
no end to them. Presently, however (this was in front of the new
Royal Exchange), there drew near another kind of crowd. There
marched six or eight sturdy fellows bearing stout cudgels and haling
along a prisoner. Round them there ran, shrieking, hooting, and
cursing, a mob of a hundred men and more; they continually
made attacks upon the guard, fighting them with sticks and fists;
but they were always thrust back. I thought at first that they had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span>
caught some poor, wretched priest whom they desired to murder.
But it proved to be a prize worth many priests. As they drew
nearer, I discerned the prisoner. He was dressed in the garb of a
common sailor, with short petticoats (which they call slops), and a
jacket; his cap had been torn off, leaving the bare skull, which
showed that he was no sailor, because common sailors do not wear
wigs; blood was flowing down his cheek from a fresh wound; his
eyes rolled hither and thither in an extremity of terror; I could
not hear what he said for the shouting of those around him, but
his lips moved, and I think he was praying his guards to close in
and protect him. Never, surely, was seen a more terror-stricken
creature.</p>

<p>I knew his face. Once seen (I had seen it once) it could never
be forgotten. The red and bloated cheeks, which even his fear
could not make pale; the eyes, more terrible than have been given
to any other human creature: these I could not forget&mdash;in dreams
I see them still. I saw that face at Exeter, when the cruel Judge
exulted over our misery and rejoiced over the sentence which he
pronounced. Yea, he laughed when he told us how we should
swing, but not till we were dead, and then the knife&mdash;delivering
his sentence so that no single point of its horror should be lost to
us. Yes; it was the face of Judge Jeffreys&mdash;none other&mdash;this
abject wretch was that great Judge. Why, when we went back to
our prison there were some who cast themselves upon the ground,
and, for terror of what was to come, fell into mere <em>dementia</em>. And
now I saw him thus humbled, thus disgraced, thus threatened, thus
in the last extremity and agony of terror.</p>

<p>They had discovered him, thus disguised and in hiding, at a
tavern in Wapping, and were dragging him to the presence of the
Lord Mayor. It is a long distance from Wapping to Guildhall,
and they went but slowly, because they were beset and surrounded
by these wolves who howled to have his blood. And all the way he
shrieked and trembled for fear!</p>

<p>Sure and certain is the vengeance of the Lord!</p>

<p>This Haman, this unjust Judge, was thus suffering, at the hands
of the savage mob, pangs far worse than those endured by the poor
rustics whom he had delivered to the executioner. I say worse,
because I have not only read, but have myself proved, that the
rich and the learned&mdash;those, that is, who live luxuriously and those
who have power to imagine and to feel beforehand&mdash;do suffer far
more in disease than the common, ignorant folk. The scholar dies
of terror before ever he feels the surgeon's knife, while the rustic
bares his limb, insensible and callous, however deep the cut or keen
the pain. I make no doubt, therefore, that the great Lord Chancellor,
while they haled him all the way from Wapping to Guildhall,
suffered as much as fifty ploughboys flogged at the cart-tail.</p>

<p>Many thousands there were who desired revenge upon him&mdash;I
know not what revenge would satisfy the implacable; because
revenge can do no more than kill the body, but his worst enemy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span>
should be satisfied with this, his dreadful fate. Even Barnaby,
who was sad because he could get no revenge on his own account
(he wanted a bloody battle, with the rout of the King's armies and
the pursuit of a flying enemy, such as had happened at Sedgemoor),
was satisfied with the justice which was done to that miserable man.
It is wonderful that he was not killed amidst so many threatening
cudgels; but his guards prevented that, not from any love they
bore him; but quite the contrary (more unforgiving faces one never
saw); for they intended to hand him over to the Lord Mayor, and
that he should be tried for all his cruelties and treacheries, and,
perhaps, experience himself that punishment of hanging and disembowelling
which he had inflicted on so many ignorant and
misled men.</p>

<p>How he was committed to the Tower, where he shortly died in
the greatest torture of body as well as mind, everybody knows.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER LI.</h2>

<h3>THE CONFESSION.</h3>


<div class="drop">
<img src="images/i_357.jpg" alt="N" width="100" height="102" class="cap" />
 <p class="cap_1">Now am I come to the last event of this history, and I
have to write down the confession of my own share in
that event. For the others&mdash;for Alice and for Robin&mdash;the
thing must be considered as the crown and
completion of all the mercies. For me&mdash;what is it?
But you shall hear. When the secrets of all hearts are laid open,
then will Alice hear it also: what she will then say, or what think,
I know not. It was done for her sake&mdash;for her happiness have I
laid this guilt upon my soul. Nay, when the voice of conscience
doth exhort me to repent, and to confess my sin, then there still
ariseth within my soul, as it were, the strain of a joyful hymn, a
song of gratitude that I was enabled to return her to freedom and
the arms of the man she loved. If any learned Doctor of Divinity,
or any versed in that science which the Romanists love (they call it
casuistry), should happen to read this chapter of confession, I pray
that they consider my case, even though it will then be useless as
far as I myself am concerned, seeing that I shall be gone before a
Judge who will, I hope (even though my earthly affections do not
suffer me to separate my sin from the consequences which followed),
be more merciful than I have deserved.</p>
</div>

<p>While, then, I stood watching this signal example of God's
wrath, I was plucked gently by the sleeve, and, turning, saw one
whose countenance I knew not. He was dressed as a lawyer, but
his gown was ragged, and his bands yellow; he looked sunk in
poverty; and his face was inflamed with those signs which proclaim
aloud the habit of immoderate drinking.</p>

<p>'Sir,' he said, 'if I mistake not, you are Dr. Humphrey Challis?'</p>

<p>'The same, Sir; at your service,' I replied with some misgivings.
And yet, being one of the Prince's following, there needed none.</p>

<p>'I have seen you, Sir, in the chambers of your cousin, Mr.
Benjamin Boscorel, my brother learned in the law. We drank
together, though (I remember) you still passed the bottle. It is
now four or five years ago. I wonder not that you have forgotten
me. We change quickly, we who are the jolly companions of the
bottle; we drink our noses red, and we paint our cheeks purple;
nay, we drink ourselves out of our last guinea, and out of our very
apparel. What then, Sir? a short life and a merry. Sir, yonder is
a sorry sight. The first Law Officer of the Crown thus to be haled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span>
along the streets by a howling mob. Ought such a thing to be
suffered? 'Tis a sad and sorry sight, I say!'</p>

<p>'Sir,' I replied hotly, 'ought such villains as Judge Jeffreys to
be suffered to live?'</p>

<p>He considered a little, as one who is astonished and desires to
collect his thoughts. Perhaps he had already taken more than a
morning draught.</p>

<p>'I remember now,' he said. 'My memory is not so good as it
was. We drink that away as well. Yes, I remember&mdash;I crave your
forgiveness, Doctor. You were yourself engaged with Monmouth.
Your cousin told me as much. Naturally you love not this good
Judge, who yet did nothing but what the King, his master, ordered
him to do. I, Sir, have often had the honour of sitting over a
bottle with his Lordship. When his infirmities allowed (though
not yet old, he is grievously afflicted) he had no equal for a song or
a jest, and would drink so long as any were left to keep him company.
Ha! they have knocked him down&mdash;now they will kill him.
No; he is again upon his feet; those who protect him close in. So&mdash;they
have passed out of our sight. Doctor, shall we crack a flask
together? I have no money, unhappily; but I will with pleasure
drink at your expense.'</p>

<p>I remembered the man's face now, but not his name. 'Twas one
of Ben's boon companions. Well; if hard drinking brings men so
speedily to rags and poverty, even though it be a merry life (which
I doubt), give me moderation.</p>

<p>'Pray, Sir,' I said coldly, 'to have me excused. I am no
drinker.'</p>

<p>'Then, Doctor, you will perhaps lend me, until we meet again,
a single guinea?'</p>

<p>I foolishly complied with this request.</p>

<p>'Doctor, I thank you,' he said. 'Will you now come and drink
with me at my expense? Sir, I say plainly, you do not well to refuse
a friendly glass. I could tell you many things, if you would
but drink with me, concerning my Lord Jeffreys. There are
things which would make you laugh. Come, Doctor; I love not to
drink alone. Your cousin, now, was always ready to drink with
any man, until he fell ill'&mdash;</p>

<p>'How? is my cousin ill?'</p>

<p>'Assuredly; he is sick unto death. Yesterday I went to visit
him, thinking to drink a glass with him, and perhaps to borrow a
guinea or two, but found him in bed and raving. If you will drink
with me, Doctor, I can tell you many curious things about your
cousin. And now I remember, you were sent to the Plantations;
your cousin told me so. You have returned before your time.
Well, the King hath run away; you are, doubtless, safe. Your
cousin hath gotten his grandfather's estate. Lord Jeffreys, who
loved him mightily, procured that grant for him. When your
cousin wakes at night he swears that he sees his grandfather by his
bedside looking at him reproachfully, so that he drinks the harder;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span>
'tis a merry life. He hath also married a wife, and she ran away
from him at the church door, and he now cannot hear of her or
find her anywhere, so that he curses her and drinks the harder.
Oh! 'tis always the jolliest dog. They say that he is not the lawyer
that he was, and that his clients are leaving him. All mine have
left me long since. Come and drink with me, Doctor.'</p>

<p>I broke away from the poor toper who had drunk up his wits
as well as his money, and hurried to my cousin's chambers, into
which I had not thought to enter save as one who brings reproaches&mdash;a
useless burden.</p>

<p>Benjamin was lying in bed: an old crone sat by the fire, nodding.
Beside her was a bottle, and she was, I found, half drunk.
Her I quickly sent about her business. No one else had been
attending him. Yet he was laid low, as I presently discovered, with
that kind of fever which is bred in the villainous air of our prisons&mdash;the
same fever which had carried off his grandfather.</p>

<p>Perhaps, if there were no foul and stinking wards, jails, and
clinks, this kind of fever would be banished altogether, and be no
more seen. So, if we could discover the origin and cause of all
diseases, we might once more restore man to his primitive condition,
which I take to have been one free from any kind of disease or
infirmity, designed at first by his Creator so to live for ever, and,
after the Fall, enabled (when medicine shall be so far advanced) to
die of old age after such prolongation of life and strength as yet
we cannot even understand.</p>

<p>'Cousin,' I said, 'I am sorry to find thee lying in this condition.'</p>

<p>'Ay,' he replied, in a voice weak and low, not like his old
blustering tones. 'Curse me and upbraid me, if thou wilt. How
art thou come hither? Is it the ghost of Humphrey? Art thou
dead like my grandfather? Are we on the Plantations of Barbadoes?'</p>

<p>'Indeed, I am no ghost, Benjamin. As for curses, I have
none; and as for reproaches, I leave them to thy conscience.'</p>

<p>'Humphrey, I am sore afflicted. I am now so low that I
cannot even sit upright in my bed. But thou art a doctor&mdash;thou
wilt bring me back to health. I am already better only for seeing
thee here.'</p>

<p>I declare that as yet I had no thought, no thought at all, of
what I was to do. I was but a physician in presence of a sick man,
and therefore bound to help him if I could.</p>

<p>I asked him first certain questions, as physicians use, concerning
his disorder and its symptoms. I learned that, after attending at
the Court, he was attacked by fits of shivering and of great heat,
being hot and cold alternately, and that in order to expel the fever
he had sat drinking the whole evening&mdash;a most dangerous thing to
do. Next, that in the morning he had been unable to rise from
his bed, and, being thirsty, had drunk more wine&mdash;a thing enough
of itself to kill a man in such a fever. Then he lost his head, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span>
could tell me no more what had happened until he saw me standing
by his bedside. In short, he had been in delirium, and was now in
a lucid interval, out of which he would presently fall a-wandering
again, and, perhaps, raving, and so another lucid interval, after
which he would die, unless something could be done for him.</p>

<p>I liked not his appearance nor the account which he gave me,
nor did I like his pulse, nor the strange look in his eyes&mdash;death doth
often show his coming by such a prophetic terror of the eyes.</p>

<p>'Humphrey,' he said pitifully. 'It was no fault of mine that
thou wast sent to the Plantations.'</p>

<p>'That I know full well, Cousin,' I answered him. 'Be easy on
that score.'</p>

<p>'And as for Alice,' he went on. 'All is fair in love.'</p>

<p>I made no reply, because at this point a great temptation
assailed my soul.</p>

<p>You have heard how I learned many secrets of the women while
I was abroad. Now, while we were in Providence Island I found a
woman of the breed they call half caste&mdash;that is, half Indian and
half Portuguese&mdash;living in what she called wedlock with an English
sailor, who did impart to me a great secret of her own people. I
obtained from her not only the knowledge of a most potent drug
(known already to the Jesuits), but also a goodly quantity of the
drug itself. This, with certain other discoveries and observations
of my own, I was about to communicate to the College in Warwick
Lane.</p>

<p>As for this drug, I verily believe it is the most potent medicine
ever yet discovered. It is now some years since it was first brought
over to Europe by the Jesuits, and is therefore called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Pulvis
Jesuiticus</i>, and sometimes Peruvian Bark. When administered
at such a stage of the fever as had now been reached by my unhappy
cousin, it seldom fails to vivify the spirits, and so to act upon
the nerves as to restore the sinking, and to call back to life a man
almost moribund.</p>

<p>Remembering this, I lugged the packet out of my pocket and
laid it on the table.</p>

<p>'Be of good cheer, Cousin,' I said; 'I have a drug which is
strong enough, with the help of God, to make a dying man sit up
again. Courage, then!'</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>When I had said these words my temptation fell upon me. It
came in the guise of a voice which whispered in my ear.</p>

<p>'Should this man die,' it said, 'there will be freedom for Alice.
She can then marry the man she loves. She will be restored to
happiness. While he lives, she must still continue in misery,
being cut off from love. Let him die therefore.'</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>'Humphrey,' said Ben; 'in this matter of Alice: if she will
come to me, I will make her happy. But I know not where she is
hidden. Things go ill with me since that unlucky day. I would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span>
to God I had not done it! Nothing hath gone well since; and I
drink daily to hide her face. Yet at night she haunts me&mdash;with
her father, who threatens, and her mother, who weeps, and my
grandfather, who reproaches. Humphrey&mdash;tell me&mdash;what is it,
man? What mean thy looks?'</p>

<p>For while he spoke that other voice was in my ears also.</p>

<p>'Should he die, Alice will be happy again. Should he live,
she will continue in misery.' At these words (which were but my
own thoughts, yet involuntary), I felt so great a pity, such an overwhelming
love for Alice, that my spirit was wholly carried away. To
restore her freedom! Oh! what price was too great for such a
gift? Nay&mdash;I was seized with the thought that to give her so
great a thing, even my own destruction would be a light price to
pay. Never, until that moment, had I known how fondly and
truly I loved her. Why, if it were to be done over again&mdash;but this
matters not. I have to make my confession.</p>

<p>'Humphrey, speak!' I suppose that my trouble showed itself
in my face.</p>

<p>'Thou art married to Alice,' I said slowly. 'That cannot be
denied. So long as thou livest, Benjamin, so long will she be
robbed of everything that she desires, so long will she be unhappy.
Now, if thou shouldst die'&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>'Die? I cannot die; I must live.' He tried to raise himself,
but he was too weak. 'Cousin, save my life.'</p>

<p>'If thou shouldst die, Benjamin,' I went on, regardless of his
words, 'she will be set free. It is only by thy death that she can
be set free. Say then to thyself: "I have done this poor woman
so great an injury that nothing but my death can atone for it.
Willingly, therefore, will I lay down my life, hoping thus to atone
for this abominable wickedness."'</p>

<p>'Humphrey, do not mock me. Give me&mdash;give me&mdash;give me
speedily the drug of which you spoke. I die&mdash;I die!&mdash;Oh!&mdash;give
me of thy drug.'</p>

<p>Then I took the packet containing the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Pulvis Jesuiticus</i> and
threw it upon the fire, where in a moment it was a little heap of
ashes.</p>

<p>'Now, Benjamin,' I said, 'I cannot help thee. Thou must
surely die.'</p>

<p>He shrieked, he wept, he implored me to do something&mdash;something
to keep him alive. He began to curse and to swear.</p>

<p>'No one can now save thee, Benjamin,' I told him. 'Not all
the College of Physicians; not all the medicines in England.
Thou must die. Listen and heed: in a short time, unless thy
present weakness causeth thee to expire, there will fall upon thee
another fit of fever and delirium, after which another interval of
reason: perhaps another&mdash;but yet thou must surely die. Prepare
thy soul, therefore. Is there any message for Alice that thou
wouldst send to her, being now at the point of death?'</p>

<p>His only answer was to curse and weep alternately.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span></p>

<p>Then I knelt beside his bed, and prayed aloud for him. But
incessantly he cried for help, wearing himself out with prayers and
curses.</p>

<p>'Benjamin,' I said, when I had thus prayed a while, but ineffectually,
'I shall take to Alice, instead of these curses, which
avail nothing, a prayer for pardon, in order to touch her heart and
cause her to think of thee with forgiveness, as of one who repented
at the end. This I shall do for her sake. I shall also tell thy
father that thy death was repentant, and shall take to him also a
prayer for forgiveness as from thee. This will lighten his sorrow,
and cause him to remember thee with the greater love. And to
Robin, too, so that he may cease to call thee villain, I will carry,
not these ravings, but a humble prayer (as from thyself) for forgiveness.'</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>This is my confession: <em>I, who might have saved my cousin,
suffered him to die</em>.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The sick man, when he found that prayers or curses would not
avail, fell to moaning, rolling his head from side to side. When
he was thus quiet I prayed again for him, exhorting him to lift up
his soul to his Judge, and assuring him of our full forgiveness.
But, indeed, I know not if he heard or understood. It was then
about four of the clock, and growing dark. I lit a candle, and examined
him again. I think that he was now unconscious. He
seemed as if he slept. I sat down and watched.</p>

<p>I think that at midnight, or thereabouts, I must have fallen
asleep.</p>

<p>When I awoke the candle was out, and the fire was out. The
room was in perfect darkness. I laid my hand upon my cousin's
forehead. He was cold and dead.</p>

<p>Then I heard the voice of the watchman in the street: 'Past
two o'clock, and a frosty morning!'</p>

<p>The voice I had heard before whispered again in my ear.</p>

<p>'Alice is free&mdash;Alice is free! Thou&mdash;thou&mdash;thou alone hast
set her free! Thou hast killed her husband!'</p>

<p>I threw myself upon my knees and spent the rest of that long
night in seeking for repentance; but then, as now, the lamentation
of a sinner is also mingled with the joy of thinking that Alice was
free at last, and by none other hand than mine.</p>

<p>This I repeat is my confession: I might have saved my cousin,
and I suffered him to die. Wherefore I have left the profession in
which it was my ambition to distinguish myself, and am no longer
anything but a poor and obscure person, living on the charity of
my friends in a remote village.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Two days afterwards I was sitting at the table, looking through
the dead man's papers, when I heard a footstep on the stair.</p>

<p>It was Barnaby, who broke noisily into the room.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span></p>

<p>'Where is Benjamin?' he cried. 'Where is that villain?'</p>

<p>'What do you want with him?'</p>

<p>'I want to kill him. I am come to kill him.'</p>

<p>'Look upon the bed, Barnaby.' I laid back the sheet and
showed him the pale face of the dead man.</p>

<p>'The hand of the Lord&mdash;or that of another&mdash;hath already killed
him. Art thou now content?'</p>

<h2>CHAPTER THE LAST.</h2>


<div class="drop">
<img src="images/i_364.jpg" alt="I" width="100" height="99" class="cap" />
 <p class="cap_1">I n the decline of years, when the sixtieth birthday is
near at hand and one looks not to live much longer,
and the future hath no fresh joy to bring with it (but
only infirmities of age and pain), it is profitable and
pleasant to look back upon the past, to observe the
guidance of the Unseen Hand, to repent one's sins, and to live over
again those seasons, whether of sorrow or of joy, which we now
perceive to have been Providentially ordered.</p>
</div>

<p>This have I done, both in reading the history of our lives as
related by my Mistress, and in writing this latter part. To the
former have I added nothing, nor have I subtracted anything
therefrom, because I would not suffer the sweet and candid soul of
her whom I have always loved to be tarnished by any words of
mine, breaking in upon her own, as jarring notes in some lovely
harmony. It is strictly laid upon me to deliver her words just as
she hath written them down.</p>

<p>Now, after the death of Benjamin, I took it upon myself, being
his cousin, in the absence of his father, to examine the papers
which he had left. Among them I found abundance of songs,
chiefly in praise of wine and women, with tavern bills. Also, there
were notes of legal cases, very voluminous, and I found notes of
payment made to various persons engaged in inquiring after his
wife, in those towns of the West Country where her father's name
would procure friends for her. But there was no will; Benjamin
had died (never looking for so early an end) without making any
will. Therefore the estate of Bradford Orcas, with the old house,
became the property of the Rector, Benjamin's father. And he,
being moved to make reparation for his son's sin, and out of the
great love which he bore to Alice, conveyed the whole to Robin on
the day of his marriage. Thus the confiscated estate returned to
the ancient family who had always held it, and promise to hold it
still, so long as the good old stock shall last.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It is thirty years ago and more. King William III. is dead;
Queen Anne is dead; King George (who cannot, they say, speak
English, but is a stout Protestant) sits upon our throne; the Nonconformists
are free, save that they cannot enter the Universities,
and are subject to other disabilities, which will, doubtless, be
removed in the course of years. But English people, I think, love
power beyond all earthly things; and so long as the Church is in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span>
majority the Churchmen will exercise their power and will not part
with it. To us of Bradford Orcas it matters little. We worship
at the parish church. Every Sunday I contemplate, as I did fifty
years ago, the monument of Filipa kneeling apart, and of her husband
and his second wife kneeling together. There is a new tablet
in the chancel put up to the memory of Sir Christopher, and
another to that of Dr. Comfort Eykin. Their bodies lie somewhere
among the mounds on the north side of Ilminster Church.</p>

<p>Forty years ago, as you have seen, there stood three boys in the
garden of the Manor House discoursing on their future. One
wished never to go anywhere, but to remain always a country
gentleman, like his grandfather; one would be a great lawyer, a
Judge, even the Lord Chancellor; the third would be a great
Physician. Lo! the end of all! The first, but after divers
miseries, perils, and wanderings, hath attained to his desire; the
second lies buried in the churchyard of St. Andrew's, Holborn,
forgotten long since by his companions (who, indeed, are now with
him in the pit), and remembered only among his own kin for the
great wickedness which he wrought before the Lord. And, as for the
third and last, no illustrious physician is he; but one who lives
obscure (but content) in a remote village (in the very cottage where
his Mistress was born), with books and music, and the society of
the sweetest woman who ever graced this earth for his solace.
She was always gracious: she was gracious in her childhood;
gracious as a maiden; more gracious still is she in these latter days
when her hair is grey, and her daughters stand about her, tall and
comely.</p>

<p>Now, had I administered that powder&mdash;that sovereign remedy,
the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Pulvis Jesuiticus</i>&mdash;what would have been her lot?</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>'Humphrey,' said Robin, 'a penny for thy thoughts.'</p>

<p>'Robin, I was thinking&mdash;it is not a new thing, but twenty years
old and more&mdash;that Cousin Benjamin never did anything in his
life so useful as to die.'</p>

<p>'Ay, poor Benjamin! That he had at the end the grace to
ask our forgiveness and to repent hath in it something of a miracle.
We have long forgiven him. But consider, Cousin. We were
saved from the fight; we were saved from the sea; we were saved
from slavery; we were enabled to strike the last blow for the Protestant
religion&mdash;what were all these blessings worth if Benjamin
still lived? To think, Humphrey, that Alice would never have
been my wife and never a mother; and all these children would
have remained unborn! I say that, though we may not desire the
death of a sinner, we were not human if we rejoiced not at the
death of our poor cousin.'</p>

<p>Yes; that is the thought which will not suffer me to repent. A
single pinch of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Pulvis Jesuiticus</i>, and he might have been living
unto this very day: then would Alice have lost the crowning blessing
of a woman's life.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span></p>

<p>Yet&mdash;I was, it is true, a physician&mdash;whose duty it is to save life,
always to save life, even the life of the wretched criminal who is
afterwards to die upon the gallows.</p>

<p>Yet, again, if he had been saved! As I write these lines I see
my Mistress walking down the village street. She looks over my
garden-gate; she lifts the latchet and enters, smiling gravely and
tenderly. A sober happiness sits upon her brow. The terror of
her first marriage has long been forgotten.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Why, as I watch her tranquil life, busy with her household and
her children, full of the piety which asks not (as her father was
wont to ask) how and where the mercy of Heaven is limited, and
if, indeed, it will embrace all she loves; as I mark the tender love
of husband and of children, which lies around her like a garment
and prevents all her doings, there comes back to me continually a
bed-room in which a man lies dying. Again in memory, again in
<em>intention</em>, I throw upon the fire that handful of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Pulvis Jesuiticus</i>
which should have driven away his fever and restored him to health
again. A great and strong man he was, who might have lived till
eighty years: where then would have been that love? where those
children? where that tranquil heart and that contented mind? '<em>I
WILL NOT SAVE HIS LIFE.</em>' I say again in my mind: '<em>I
WILL NOT SAVE HIM; HE SHALL DIE.</em>'</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>'Humphrey,' my Mistress says, 'leave thy books awhile and
walk with me: the winter sun is warm upon the hills. Come, it is
the day when Benjamin died&mdash;repentant&mdash;what better could we
wish? What greater blessing could have been bestowed upon him
and upon us than a true repentance and to die? Oh! dear Brother,
dear Humphrey, let us walk and talk of these blessings which have
been showered upon my undeserving head.</p>
